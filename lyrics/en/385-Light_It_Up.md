[Intro]
(Matches striking, fire starting)
The fire is lit...

[Verse 1]
I saw America lit up like flames
Every city, every name
Fire spreading coast to coast
Judgment burning what you boast

[Chorus]
Light it up, the fire's here
Judgment burning far and near
What you built in pride and sin
Burns to ash and blows with wind
Light it up

[Verse 2]
Nuclear, natural, take your pick
Fire comes so hot and quick
Cities burning all at once
Paying for your ignorance

[Bridge]
The Lord's purifying fire
Burns away the sin and liar
Nothing left but what is pure
Those in Christ remain secure

[Chorus]
Light it up, the fire's here
Judgment burning far and near
What you built in pride and sin
Burns to ash and blows with wind
Light it up

[Outro]
(Fire crackling then silence)
Burn away the dross...
