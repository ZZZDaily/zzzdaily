[Intro]
(Chinese military drums)
They are not preparing... they are prepared...

[Verse 1]
Western world thinks they have time
China's building war machines in line
Precision taught from childhood days
Assembly lines with perfect ways

[Chorus]
China is ready, don't be deceived
The dragon waits for what he'll achieve
Colonization of the world reborn
China is ready, America be warned

[Verse 2]
Tactical warfare, aerial might
Guns that shoot from impossible sight
Thwip thwip thwip before you fire once
Twenty bullets make you the dunce

[Bridge]
Same goals as Russia, expand and take
Every border, every stake
New colonization led by these two powers
America's final hours

[Chorus]
China is ready, don't be deceived
The dragon waits for what he'll achieve
Colonization of the world reborn
China is ready, America be warned

[Outro]
(Fading military sounds)
They're watching... waiting...
