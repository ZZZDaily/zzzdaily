[Intro]
(Trading floor sounds, ominous)
Commerce Department pick, Howard Lutnick's name
Cantor Fitzgerald's chief, now a different game

[Verse 1]
From 9/11 tragedy to Trump's cabinet seat
Lutnick positioned to make the deal complete
Satellogic board member, carbon credits too
The financial control grid, right on cue
Commerce Department shaping trade and tech
Howard Lutnick Commerce, sign the check

[Chorus]
Howard Lutnick Commerce, finance meets the state
Building infrastructure for control's new fate
Howard Lutnick Commerce, Wall Street to DC
The revolving door spinning endlessly

[Verse 2]
Dollar-denominated debt, that's the true agenda
Global financial control grid, no surrender
From carbon credits to crypto regulation
Howard Lutnick Commerce, financial domination
The same networks Whitney Webb exposed
Howard Lutnick Commerce, circle closed

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
When Wall Street runs commerce
And commerce runs trade
The people's economy
Is what they invade

[Verse 3]
Unlimited Hangout connected every dot
Howard Lutnick Commerce, like it or not
Know the players, watch the moves they make
Howard Lutnick Commerce, see what's at stake

[Outro]
(Trading sounds fade)
Follow the appointments, follow the money flow
Howard Lutnick Commerce running the show
