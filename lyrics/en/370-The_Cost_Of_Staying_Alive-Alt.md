[Intro]
(Survival sounds, difficult breathing)
What will you sacrifice...

[Verse 1]
In the days ahead survival's hard
Every single thing on guard
What price will you have to pay
Just to live another day?

[Chorus]
The cost of staying alive is high
Many will wish that they could die
Every comfort stripped away
Survival is the prayer you'll pray
The cost of staying alive

[Verse 2]
Character tested to the bone
Everything you've ever known
Changed and twisted beyond repair
Only faith will keep you there

[Bridge]
Some will compromise their soul
Trading eternity for a role
In the beast system's game
But God will not forget your name

[Chorus]
The cost of staying alive is high
Many will wish that they could die
Every comfort stripped away
Survival is the prayer you'll pray
The cost of staying alive

[Outro]
(Survival sounds fading)
Count the cost...
