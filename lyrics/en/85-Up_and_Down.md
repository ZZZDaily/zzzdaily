SONG 8: "Up and Down"
(Theme: A theological reflection on the reality of heaven above and hell below, and the literal spatial nature of spiritual realms.)

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
They tell you it's a spinning ball,
But the Word says it don't move at all,
Heaven's up and hell's below,
Just like the ancient prophets know.

[Chorus]
Up is up and down is down,
Heaven's throne above the ground,
Hell beneath where lost souls drown,
Space ain't curved, it's flat around.

[Verse 2]
MIT admits it in their code,
Flat earth assumption, truth unfolds,
Coriolis forces they ignore,
'Cause the spin was always folklore.

[Chorus]
Up is up and down is down,
Heaven's throne above the ground,
Hell beneath where lost souls drown,
Space ain't curved, it's flat around.

[Verse 3]
NASA's lying through their teeth,
CGI is all you see beneath,
But the firmament's above our head,
Just like Genesis always said.

[Verse 4]
Jesus ascended to the sky,
Satan fell from way up high,
Directions matter, they are real,
Not some relative appeal.

[Chorus]
Up is up and down is down,
Heaven's throne above the ground,
Hell beneath where lost souls drown,
Space ain't curved, it's flat around.

[Bridge]
They want you lost in endless space,
No throne above, no judgment place,
But the truth is fixed and plain to see,
God's above for eternity!

[Chorus]
Up is up and down is down,
Heaven's throne above the ground,
Hell beneath where lost souls drown,
Space ain't curved, it's flat around.

[Outro]
Heaven's up... hell's down below,
Just like the Bible told you so.
