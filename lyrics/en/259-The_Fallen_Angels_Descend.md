[Intro]
(Ethereal, otherworldly sounds)
And there was war in heaven...

[Verse 1]
There's a hole opening in the sky above
Not the rapture, not the coming of the dove
Something else is breaking through the veil
Ancient beings with a dark and bitter tale

[Chorus]
The fallen angels descend to earth tonight
Satan cast down with all his might
They're coming through the portals burning bright
The fallen angels descend

[Verse 2]
They ruled in Egypt, Greece, and Rome
The gods of old are coming home
Zeus and Hera, Poseidon too
All fallen angels returning to rule you

[Bridge]
Woe to the earth, woe to the sea
The devil comes down furiously
For he knows his time is short
Heaven celebrates, but earth mourns

[Chorus]
The fallen angels descend to earth tonight
Satan cast down with all his might
They're coming through the portals burning bright
The fallen angels descend

[Outro]
(Celestial sounds fading to darkness)
Watch the skies... watch the skies...
