[Intro]
(Missile launch sounds)
Arrows, I heard the Lord say, Arrows!

[Verse 1]
Nuclear missiles in the sky tonight
Arrows of judgment, heaven's might
Coming for America from afar
Striking down the fallen star

[Chorus]
Arrows in the sky, the end has come
Fire and brimstone, there's nowhere to run
Multiple cities hit at once
America pays for all her stunts
Arrows in the sky

[Verse 2]
Sudden attack from enemies near
The smoke of Babylon seen from here
Visible on satellite display
The end of America's final day

[Bridge]
Treachery from within your gates
Conspirators decided your fate
While you slept they made their plan
Now destruction covers the land

[Chorus]
Arrows in the sky, the end has come
Fire and brimstone, there's nowhere to run
Multiple cities hit at once
America pays for all her stunts
Arrows in the sky

[Outro]
(Explosions fading)
Watch and pray...
