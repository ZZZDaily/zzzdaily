[Intro]
(Formula 1 sounds, party ambience)
Italy's Donald Trump, Flavio Briatore's name
Naomi Campbell connection, part of the game

[Verse 1]
Trump administration mismanaged the Epstein release
But some names they protected, they'll never cease
Briatore tied to Trump through business and more
Italian billionaire opening every door
Formula 1 circles, supermodel crew
The Epstein network connections grew and grew

[Chorus]
Flavio Briatore files, names they didn't release
The network runs deeper, it'll never cease
Flavio Briatore files, Trump connections strong
Why protect these players? Something's wrong

[Verse 2]
Naomi Campbell, Briatore's former flame
Traveling with Ghislaine, part of the game
Little black book entries, flight log names
Flavio Briatore files, playing games
Trump's reticence to release it all
Flavio Briatore files behind the wall

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
When they promise transparency
Then protect their friends
The justice system
Never truly mends

[Verse 3]
Whitney Webb investigated what they wanted to hide
Flavio Briatore files, cast aside
The players protecting each other still
Flavio Briatore files, against our will

[Outro]
(F1 and party sounds fade)
Release all the files, let the people see
Flavio Briatore files, set the truth free
