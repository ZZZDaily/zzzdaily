[Intro]
(Ethereal possession sounds)
And the angel entered the man...

[Verse 1]
I saw an angel descend from high
Not from God but from the sky
It entered into a man below
And took over, don't you know

[Chorus]
The angel who entered the man
Part of Satan's master plan
Possession on a massive scale
When fallen angels pierce the veil
The angel entered

[Verse 2]
This will happen everywhere
Beings entering from the air
Taking over human shells
Creating walking living hells

[Bridge]
When the serpents fall to earth
Demon hosts will have their birth
In human bodies all around
The taken making no sound

[Chorus]
The angel who entered the man
Part of Satan's master plan
Possession on a massive scale
When fallen angels pierce the veil
The angel entered

[Outro]
(Possession sounds fading)
Guard your soul...
