[Intro]
(Copy machine sounds, then sinister)
Not everything is what it seems...

[Verse 1]
Satan counterfeits everything
Resurrection, worship, king
Fake miracles and lying signs
Crossing all the boundary lines

[Chorus]
Counterfeits among us now
False Christs teaching us how
To worship at the wrong feet
Deception on every street
Counterfeits among us

[Verse 2]
Aliens that aren't from space
Just demons wearing different face
Superheroes on the screen
Programming what hasn't been seen

[Bridge]
Test the spirits like John said
Many false prophets have spread
Only truth survives the test
Jesus Christ above the rest

[Chorus]
Counterfeits among us now
False Christs teaching us how
To worship at the wrong feet
Deception on every street
Counterfeits among us

[Outro]
(Sinister sounds fading)
Test every spirit...
