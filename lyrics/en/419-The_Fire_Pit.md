[Intro]
(Roaring flames)
America becomes a fire pit...

[Verse 1]
The whole land burns in flames
Every city, every name
A fire pit from coast to coast
America becomes a ghost

[Chorus]
The fire pit of judgment burns
Every way the sinner turns
Nowhere left to run or hide
Fire consuming every side
The fire pit

[Verse 2]
God's wrath poured out at last
Present punished for the past
The sins of generations paid
In fire nothing can evade

[Bridge]
Only those who call His name
Walk unburned through the flame
Like Shadrach and his friends
God protects until the end

[Chorus]
The fire pit of judgment burns
Every way the sinner turns
Nowhere left to run or hide
Fire consuming every side
The fire pit

[Outro]
(Flames crackling then fading)
Call on His name...
