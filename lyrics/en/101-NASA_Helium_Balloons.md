[Intro]
Twenty-five billion dollars every year
For CGI and smoke screens, crystal clear

[Verse 1]
Watch the rockets wobble as they rise
Helium behavior right before your eyes
Cut the footage every single time
Space is real but the launches are a crime

[Chorus]
Are space rockets filled with helium gas?
Floating to the firmament, putting on a mass
NASA never shows continuous video
Just a bunch of cuts, what don't they want to show?

[Verse 2]
Astronauts on wires in their swimming pool
Training in a studio making us the fool
Bubbles rising up in "outer space"
Harness glitches, CGI disgrace

[Bridge]
Fifty-eight years of propaganda before Sputnik flew
Conditioning the masses, nothing ever new
Operation Paperclip brought Nazi minds
Disney and Von Braun, strange bedfellows combined

[Chorus]
Are space rockets filled with helium gas?
Floating to the firmament, putting on a mass
NASA never shows continuous video
Just a bunch of cuts, what don't they want to show?

[Outro]
Space is real, the question isn't that
It's what they're hiding underneath the hat
Follow where the money goes each year
The truth behind the rockets should be clear
