[Intro]
(Military drums and Orthodox choir)
Out of the north... an enemy comes...

[Verse 1]
I have commanded my sanctified ones
Russia will rise when judgment comes
The bear awakens from his northern lair
America spread thin beyond repair

[Chorus]
Russia will rise against Babylon's pride
China beside her, nowhere to hide
What you did to others comes back to you
Every war crime, every debt that's due
Russia will rise

[Verse 2]
They'll mirror everything you've ever done
Your soldiers' sins beneath the foreign sun
The camps you built on foreign soil
Will fill with Americans in turmoil

[Bridge]
The flag comes down, the eagle falls
The Russian soldier walks your halls
"Where is your movie victory now?"
Before the conqueror all will bow

[Chorus]
Russia will rise against Babylon's pride
China beside her, nowhere to hide
What you did to others comes back to you
Every war crime, every debt that's due
Russia will rise

[Outro]
(Fading military march)
Prepare... prepare...
