[Intro]
(Computer sounds, all-seeing eye imagery)
After 9/11, Admiral Poindexter dreamed
Total Information Awareness, or so it seemed

[Verse 1]
DARPA program to collect it all
Every phone call, every shopping mall
Congress defunded it, too Orwellian they said
But the agenda wasn't actually dead
Privatized through Palantir, the dream lives on
Total Information Awareness, from dusk to dawn

[Chorus]
Total Information Awareness, they renamed the beast
Privatized surveillance, never ceased
Total Information Awareness, hiding in plain sight
Every transaction monitored day and night

[Verse 2]
Poindexter from Iran-Contra, criminal past
Now designing surveillance systems built to last
The all-seeing eye logo, they didn't even hide
Total Information Awareness, along for the ride
Snowden revealed how far it really went
Total Information Awareness, government spent

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
When they tell you it's dead
Don't believe the lie
Surveillance programs
Never really die

[Verse 3]
Whitney Webb connected Palantir to the source
Total Information Awareness stays the course
The name changed but the mission remains
Total Information Awareness, freedom in chains

[Outro]
(Computer sounds fade to silence)
The surveillance state never sleeps, never stops
Total Information Awareness, until it drops
