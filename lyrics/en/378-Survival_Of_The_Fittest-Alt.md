[Intro]
(Darwinian sounds, struggle)
Not the strong but the righteous...

[Verse 1]
They say survival goes to the strong
But God has said that they are wrong
It's not the fittest who survive
But those in whom His Spirit's alive

[Chorus]
Survival of the fittest is a lie
Many strong ones soon will die
The meek inherit what remains
Those in Christ break all the chains
Survival through the Lord

[Verse 2]
Physical strength won't save you then
When demons walk among all men
Only faith and righteousness
Bring you through the wilderness

[Bridge]
Store up oil in your lamp
Through the tribulation's camp
Those who know their God are strong
They alone will carry on

[Chorus]
Survival of the fittest is a lie
Many strong ones soon will die
The meek inherit what remains
Those in Christ break all the chains
Survival through the Lord

[Outro]
(Struggle sounds fading)
Be strong in the Lord...
