[Intro]
(Hospital sounds, flatlines)
A hard winter coming...

[Verse 1]
God said in the cold seasons
Active dying for many reasons
Unexplained fevers everywhere
Young and healthy in despair

[Chorus]
They will die, they will die
Vaccine victims multiplied
Population density shifts
As the death toll upward lifts
They will die

[Verse 2]
Record numbers falling sick
Some die slow and some die quick
Weird patterns, strange disease
No one knows what will appease

[Bridge]
The manic push to vaccinate
Was preparing for this fate
Winter comes to do the job
While the families can only sob

[Chorus]
They will die, they will die
Vaccine victims multiplied
Population density shifts
As the death toll upward lifts
They will die

[Outro]
(Flatlines fading)
The hard winter is here...
