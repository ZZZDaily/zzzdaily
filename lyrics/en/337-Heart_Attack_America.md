[Intro]
(Heartbeat slowing, then irregular)
The heart of America will fail...

[Verse 1]
A heart attack upon the land
Not medical, but judgment's hand
The center of the nation strikes
Crippling everything it likes

[Chorus]
Heart attack America
The vital organs fail
Infrastructure collapses down
A ship without a sail
Heart attack America

[Verse 2]
Power grids go dark at once
No more warning, no more stunts
The heart that pumped the nation's blood
Stops beating in the flood

[Bridge]
Russia strikes at vital points
The system then disjoints
What took decades to construct
In moments lies corrupt

[Chorus]
Heart attack America
The vital organs fail
Infrastructure collapses down
A ship without a sail
Heart attack America

[Outro]
(Heartbeat flatline)
The heart stops...
