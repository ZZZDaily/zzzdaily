[Intro]
(Rainbow imagery, then storm)
They stole God's sign...

[Verse 1]
God set a rainbow in the sky
A promise that He won't destroy
By flood the earth again
But man has stolen it, amen?

[Chorus]
The rainbow and men have clashed
God's covenant symbol trashed
Pride parades beneath the bow
Judgment comes, they do not know
The rainbow belongs to God

[Verse 2]
What God meant for covenant love
Twisted by the ones above
Who hate His perfect design
Claiming God's sign as their sign

[Bridge]
Homosexuality was judged before
Sodom knows what's in store
The rainbow is God's property
Not for human debauchery

[Chorus]
The rainbow and men have clashed
God's covenant symbol trashed
Pride parades beneath the bow
Judgment comes, they do not know
The rainbow belongs to God

[Outro]
(Storm sounds)
Repent and return...
