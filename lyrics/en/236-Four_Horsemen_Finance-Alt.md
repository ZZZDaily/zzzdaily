[Intro]
(Horsemen sounds, financial collapse)
The four horsemen of financial control ride
Digital ID, CBDC, surveillance, and pride

[Verse 1]
First comes the digital identity for all
Mark of compliance, answering the call
Second rides CBDC, programmable money's curse
Every transaction monitored, for better or worse
Third is surveillance, Palantir's domain
Four horsemen finance, driving us insane

[Chorus]
Four horsemen finance, apocalypse of control
Taking everything from you, body and soul
Four horsemen finance, the elite's design
Converging systems, intertwined

[Verse 2]
Fourth is the smart grid, energy controlled
Four horsemen finance, leaving you cold
Turn off your power, turn off your pay
Four horsemen finance, that's what they say
All integrated in one system complete
Four horsemen finance, defeat

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Each horseman alone
Is bad enough to bear
But together riding
Is technocratic nightmare

[Verse 3]
Whitney Webb connected all four beasts as one
Four horsemen finance, see what they've done
Resist each horseman, don't let them converge
Four horsemen finance, time to emerge

[Outro]
(Horsemen fade to silence)
Stand against each pillar of their control
Four horsemen finance, protect your soul
