[Intro]
(808 beat meets church organ)
Bad Boy Records, freak-off parties in the night
Same network as Epstein, hiding in plain sight

[Verse 1]
Sean Combs didn't climb alone to the top
His father Melvin tied to Gambino, full stop
Federal informant, murdered in the street
The mob and intelligence forever did meet
Andre Harrell, Clive Davis showed him the way
MCA and Arista, intelligence at play

[Chorus]
Diddy shadow network, one label under blackmail
Organized crime meets intelligence, same tale
Diddy shadow network, freak-offs filmed for control
Music industry puppets serving a darker goal

[Verse 2]
Russell Simmons, Lew Wasserman, Meyer Lansky's heir
Al Malnik in the shadows, Brett Ratner there
The same mega group that surrounded Epstein's ring
Controlled the entertainment, made the puppet sing
Private prison industry funding hip-hop's turn
Destroy the community, profits to earn

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Ron Burkle connected both worlds
Epstein and Diddy's domain
When the music stops playing
The blackmail still remains

[Verse 3]
Whitney Webb connected it all, from Combs to the spies
One Label Under Blackmail, opening our eyes
The recording industry was never just music and fun
Diddy shadow network, and the truth has just begun

[Outro]
(Beat and organ merge then fade)
Homeland security said he's as bad as Epstein was
Diddy shadow network, serving the same cause
