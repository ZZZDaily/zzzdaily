[Intro]
They fought the revolution over tea
Now they take a third of every paycheck that you see

[Verse 1]
Sixteen Amendment didn't give them any power
Supreme Court said it twenty-seven times in every hour
Income means profit, that's what the law defines
Trading time for wages ain't no gain in these lines

[Chorus]
Income tax is slavery, it's plain as day
Labor is an exchange, not profit they can take away
You're entitled to the fruits of your toil
But they've been robbing you while making your blood boil

[Verse 2]
The Constitution says direct tax must apportion
But they got creative with their legal distortion
Treasury can say whatever they decide
But they cannot make law, their hands are tied

[Bridge]
Where does all that money really go?
Certainly not to services you know
Black budgets, foreign wars, and CIA
Nine hundred billion with no word to say

[Chorus]
Income tax is slavery, it's plain as day
Labor is an exchange, not profit they can take away
You're entitled to the fruits of your toil
But they've been robbing you while making your blood boil

[Outro]
Don't just stop paying, read the law
Understand the game before you draw
Knowledge is power when you know your rights
Illuminati schemes exposed to light
