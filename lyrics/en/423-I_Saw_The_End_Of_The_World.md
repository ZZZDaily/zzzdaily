[Intro]
(Apocalyptic sounds)
The end has come...

[Verse 1]
I saw the end of all things known
Every seed that has been sown
Harvested in fire and blood
Humanity beneath the flood

[Chorus]
I saw the end of the world tonight
Heaven's armies in the fight
Everything exactly as God said
Living and the walking dead
I saw the end

[Verse 2]
Christ returns upon the clouds
Heaven's trumpet ringing loud
Every knee shall bow down low
Every tongue shall surely know

[Bridge]
This is not a fairy tale
The ship of grace has set sail
Either you're aboard with Christ
Or pay the ultimate price

[Chorus]
I saw the end of the world tonight
Heaven's armies in the fight
Everything exactly as God said
Living and the walking dead
I saw the end

[Outro]
(Apocalyptic sounds transforming to glory)
Jesus is coming...
