[Intro]
(Ethereal, mysterious tones)
What is this descending...

[Verse 1]
I saw a mist come down from high
A silver covering from the sky
Enveloping everything it touched
Some cried out, some were hushed

[Chorus]
The silver mist descends tonight
Supernatural, strange the sight
What is coming none can say
Prepare for an unusual day
The silver mist

[Verse 2]
End time signs that none expect
Phenomena we can't inspect
God revealing in the skies
Things that open up our eyes

[Bridge]
The natural order breaks apart
Signs foretold from the very start
Things we've never seen before
Knocking on humanity's door

[Chorus]
The silver mist descends tonight
Supernatural, strange the sight
What is coming none can say
Prepare for an unusual day
The silver mist

[Outro]
(Ethereal sounds fading)
Watch and pray...
