[Intro]
(UFO/sci-fi sounds)
They will say we come in peace...

[Verse 1]
Silver discs across the sky
The world will ask the question why
Governments admit what they've denied
But truth is something different inside

[Chorus]
The alien deception comes
Fallen angels dressed as space-faring ones
Do not believe the coming lie
They're not from space, they fell from on high
The alien deception

[Verse 2]
Grey aliens with big dark eyes
Just another satanic disguise
Breeding programs underground
Hybrid children all around

[Bridge]
They'll say they seeded life on earth
A false narrative of our birth
Drawing hearts away from God
With technological facade

[Chorus]
The alien deception comes
Fallen angels dressed as space-faring ones
Do not believe the coming lie
They're not from space, they fell from on high
The alien deception

[Outro]
(UFO sounds fading)
Test every spirit... test every spirit...
