[Intro]
(Temple sounds, then horror)
When you see it standing in the holy place...

[Verse 1]
Daniel's prophecy in motion
The abomination's dark devotion
Standing where it shouldn't be
The sign for all the world to see

[Chorus]
The abomination of desolation
Signals the final tribulation
Flee to the mountains when it's seen
The worst the world has ever been
The abomination

[Verse 2]
Those in Judea run away
Pray it's not on Sabbath day
Don't go back for anything
The tribulation it will bring

[Bridge]
Great distress like never known
Since the first seed ever sown
If God doesn't cut it short
No flesh survives this evil sport

[Chorus]
The abomination of desolation
Signals the final tribulation
Flee to the mountains when it's seen
The worst the world has ever been
The abomination

[Outro]
(Horror sounds fading)
Watch for the sign...
