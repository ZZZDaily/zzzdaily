[Intro]
(Jungle sounds meet blockchain beeps)
They're tokenizing the Amazon, sensor network wide
Intelligence-linked firms, nothing to hide

[Verse 1]
BlackRock's ETF architect teaming up now
To borgify the jungle, let me tell you how
Large-scale sensor network, IoT deployed
Amazon tokenization, nature destroyed
New form of digital gold, they proudly claim
Amazon tokenization, money's new game

[Chorus]
Amazon tokenization, forest on the chain
Surveillance of nature, profit from the rain
Amazon tokenization, digital gold scheme
Colonizing the jungle, living their dream

[Verse 2]
US intelligence connections running deep
Amazon tokenization, secrets they keep
Indigenous peoples, where do they fit?
Amazon tokenization, corporate writ
The lungs of the Earth now belong to finance
Amazon tokenization's deadly dance

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
When nature becomes
Just another asset class
The sacred is profaned
Behind financial glass

[Verse 3]
Whitney Webb exposed who's behind the scheme
Amazon tokenization, not what it seems
The jungle is not for their blockchain games
Amazon tokenization, know their names

[Outro]
(Jungle sounds return, blockchain fades)
Leave the Amazon wild, not tokenized
Amazon tokenization, see through their guise
