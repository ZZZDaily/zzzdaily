[Intro]
(DNA helix sounds, transformation)
Something new arising...

[Verse 1]
Iron and clay mixing together
Hybrid beings, changed forever
Not quite human anymore
Something different at the core

[Chorus]
The new man rises from the labs
Gene editing, biotech stabs
Transformation of the race
Satan counterfeiting grace
The new man

[Verse 2]
If you modify your flesh
With the AI's iron mesh
God has said you cannot be
His for all eternity

[Bridge]
Keep your humanity intact
Reject the transhumanist pact
Stay as God created you
The only way to make it through

[Chorus]
The new man rises from the labs
Gene editing, biotech stabs
Transformation of the race
Satan counterfeiting grace
The new man

[Outro]
(DNA sounds fading)
Stay human...
