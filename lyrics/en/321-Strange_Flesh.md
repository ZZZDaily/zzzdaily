[Intro]
(Disturbing whispers)
As it was in the days of Noah...

[Verse 1]
Even as Sodom going after strange flesh
Eternal fire for those who transgress
People will join with beings not human
Fallen angels seducing men and women

[Chorus]
Strange flesh, strange flesh they pursue
Mating with things both old and new
Rivers in the streets of sin
The judgment must begin
Strange flesh

[Verse 2]
As the iron doesn't cleave to clay
So these unions will not stay
But Satan pushes for more mixing
Genetic code forever switching

[Bridge]
The fallen make their overtures
Opening supernatural doors
People willingly joining their bodies
To these demonic entities

[Chorus]
Strange flesh, strange flesh they pursue
Mating with things both old and new
Rivers in the streets of sin
The judgment must begin
Strange flesh

[Outro]
(Whispers fading)
Guard your temple...
