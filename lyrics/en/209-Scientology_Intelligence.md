[Intro]
(Eerie synths, mysterious)
Church of Scientology, stranger than it seems
Intelligence connections in their dreams

[Verse 1]
L. Ron Hubbard worked adjacent to MK-ULTRA's reign
Drug trafficking operations, following the chain
Since its founding, Scientology intertwined
With intelligence agencies of every kind
Operation Snow White, infiltrating governments worldwide
Scientology intelligence, nothing to hide

[Chorus]
Scientology intelligence, more than just a church
Deep connections revealed through research
Scientology intelligence, the founder's history
Wrapped in espionage and mystery

[Verse 2]
Celebrity Centre capturing stars of every kind
Scientology intelligence, controlling minds
The investigations barely scratch the surface deep
Scientology intelligence, secrets they keep
Unlimited Hangout's series just begun
Scientology intelligence, never done

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
When religion is cover
For operations dark
The faithful never see
The intelligence mark

[Verse 3]
Whitney Webb investigating the church's past
Scientology intelligence, die is cast
More revelations coming, stay awake
Scientology intelligence, for freedom's sake

[Outro]
(Synths fade mysteriously)
Question every institution, every creed
Scientology intelligence plants the seed
