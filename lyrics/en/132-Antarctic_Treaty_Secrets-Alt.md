[Intro]
Every nation agrees on just one thing
What's in Antarctica that they're protecting?

[Verse 1]
Sixty South, that's where you stop
Armed guards making sure you drop
Tourist areas, designated spots
Try to explore, you're caught in knots

[Chorus]
Antarctic Treaty, what are they hiding?
All these nations finally coinciding
North and South, they disagree on everything
But Antarctica's where they close the ring

[Verse 2]
Admiral Byrd talked about what he saw
Operation High Jump, something in his maw
Green lands beyond the ice they claim
Classified, can't speak his name

[Bridge]
Drone shot down if you fly too far
What could possibly be bizarre?
Flat earth edge or ancient base?
Something they don't want you to face

[Chorus]
Antarctic Treaty, what are they hiding?
All these nations finally coinciding
North and South, they disagree on everything
But Antarctica's where they close the ring

[Outro]
One day the truth will come to light
Until then they'll guard with all their might
The last frontier we're not allowed to see
What's really there for you and me?
