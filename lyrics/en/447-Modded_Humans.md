[Intro]
(Modification sounds)
Modding humanity...

[Verse 1]
Bionic arms and neural links
Modifications that one thinks
Will make them better, faster, strong
But it's taking them along

[Chorus]
Modded humans lose their soul
Technology takes control
Once you add the iron parts
God removes you from His charts
Modded humans

[Verse 2]
Voluntary amputation
For the bionic generation
Removing limbs that work just fine
Crossing the divine line

[Bridge]
Stay as God created you
The only way to make it through
Once you join the iron frame
You can never be the same

[Chorus]
Modded humans lose their soul
Technology takes control
Once you add the iron parts
God removes you from His charts
Modded humans

[Outro]
(Modification sounds fading)
Stay fully human...
