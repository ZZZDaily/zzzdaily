[Intro]
(Heartbeat, violence sounds)
New York, the bloody city...

[Verse 1]
New York drowns in blood and sin
Wickedness without and within
The bloody city God proclaims
Written down in judgment's flames

[Chorus]
The bloody city pays the price
For every sin, for every vice
New York's judgment has been sealed
Every hidden thing revealed
The bloody city

[Verse 2]
Wall Street's greed, Times Square's sin
Broadway's pride from deep within
All the blood that's been spilled here
Cries aloud for God to hear

[Bridge]
Babylon's jewel will fall the hardest
Judgment strikes the proudest, darkest
What was bright will be made dim
New York's cup filled to the brim

[Chorus]
The bloody city pays the price
For every sin, for every vice
New York's judgment has been sealed
Every hidden thing revealed
The bloody city

[Outro]
(Violent sounds fading)
Flee the city...
