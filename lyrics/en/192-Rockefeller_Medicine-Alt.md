[Intro]
(Old blues guitar, medical sounds)
Hundred years ago they made a plan
Rockefeller medicine reshaping man

[Verse 1]
Flexner Report of 1910, that was the start
Taking control of medical art
Traditional healing pushed aside
Pharmaceutical industry on the ride
John D. Rockefeller saw the future clear
Oil-based medicine, profit from fear

[Chorus]
Rockefeller medicine, a century old scheme
Controlling how we heal, crushing every dream
Rockefeller medicine, the foundation laid
For Big Pharma's empire and the fortunes made

[Verse 2]
Schools funded to teach their way alone
Alternative healing turned to stone
Eugenics programs, sterilization too
Rockefeller Foundation, look at what they do
Carnegie partner in the medical plan
Rockefeller medicine, controlling man

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
They funded both the research
And the cure they claim
Controlling every outcome
In medicine's game

[Verse 3]
Whitney Webb traced the modern implications
Rockefeller medicine across the nations
UN, WHO, same foundations in control
Rockefeller medicine taking its toll

[Outro]
(Blues guitar fades)
Reclaim your health from their grip
Rockefeller medicine, time to let it slip
