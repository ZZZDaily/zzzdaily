[Intro]
(Mystical, dark tones)
A new America with new gods...

[Verse 1]
Devi and Shet, God showed their names
Hindu gods playing power games
A new America will emerge
With foreign gods upon the verge

[Chorus]
Devi and Shet, the gods they serve
America will get what she deserves
Foreign deities on the throne
The true God's children left alone
Devi and Shet

[Verse 2]
Kamala's gods will have their say
When she rises in that day
India's demons in the land
America in occult hands

[Bridge]
The Judeo-Christian facade
Replaced by every foreign god
The nation founded under God
Now tramples what the founders trod

[Chorus]
Devi and Shet, the gods they serve
America will get what she deserves
Foreign deities on the throne
The true God's children left alone
Devi and Shet

[Outro]
(Dark tones fading)
One God alone...
