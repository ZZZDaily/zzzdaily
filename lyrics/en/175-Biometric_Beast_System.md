[Intro]
(Ominous organ, heartbeat sounds)
Your body is the password, your iris the key
Biometric beast system, and nothing is free

[Verse 1]
Fingerprints and face scans, retina recognition
The UN and BIS designed this digital prison
They call it closing the identity gap, sounds kind
But it's total surveillance of all humankind
Linked to your finances, linked to every door
Without biometric ID, you don't exist anymore

[Chorus]
Biometric beast system, your flesh is the mark
Buy and sell with your body in the digital dark
Biometric beast system, revelation comes true
They can't control your spirit, but they'll try to control you

[Verse 2]
QR codes tracking everywhere you dine
Every restaurant visit building your profile fine
Lose your phone, you lose your identity complete
Blackmail and hacking put you on the street
Health data merged with financial score
One system to rule them all, that's what they're building for

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
The mark isn't tomorrow
It's being built today
Biometric onboarding
Is already underway

[Verse 3]
Whitney Webb explained how it all connects
Digital ID, CBDC, surveillance intersects
But humans have a spirit that can't be controlled
Biometric beast system, we won't be sold

[Outro]
(Organ fades, heartbeat continues)
Resist the mark, refuse the scan
Biometric beast system isn't God's plan
