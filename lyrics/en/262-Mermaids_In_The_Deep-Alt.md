[Intro]
(Ocean sounds, eerie melody)
From the doorways in the sea...

[Verse 1]
The fisherman pulled his net one evening tide
Something fought and thrashed, it couldn't hide
Blue-grey skin and razor teeth
A woman's form with fins beneath

[Chorus]
Mermaids in the deep, they drink your blood
Rising from the waters, coming like a flood
Nephilim of the ocean, Satan's bride
Mermaids in the deep can no longer hide

[Verse 2]
She hissed and fought with dying breath
Drowning in air, gasping death
If she had strength she'd tear him apart
One million shreds from his beating heart

[Bridge]
They'll find them more and more
Washing up on every shore
So mankind can repent and believe
What's living underneath the seas

[Chorus]
Mermaids in the deep, they drink your blood
Rising from the waters, coming like a flood
Nephilim of the ocean, Satan's bride
Mermaids in the deep can no longer hide

[Outro]
(Fading ocean waves)
They are real... they are real...
