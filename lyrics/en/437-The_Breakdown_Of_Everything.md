[Intro]
(Systems failing sounds)
Nothing works anymore...

[Verse 1]
Infrastructure falling down
Every system in every town
Healthcare, banking, all the rest
America fails every test

[Chorus]
The breakdown of everything you know
Services stop, nothing flows
What you trusted to remain
Crumbles in the coming rain
The breakdown

[Verse 2]
Supply chains breaking fast
Nothing you have built will last
Food and medicine run dry
While the leaders wave goodbye

[Bridge]
Every convenience disappears
Everything you loved for years
Self-reliance now the norm
Shelter yourself from the storm

[Chorus]
The breakdown of everything you know
Services stop, nothing flows
What you trusted to remain
Crumbles in the coming rain
The breakdown

[Outro]
(Failing sounds completing)
Depend on God alone...
