SONG 6: "Kingdom Fellowship"
(Theme: A celebration of community and connection among believers who share uncommon truths and support each other.)

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
They study the light to keep us in dark,
Hide ancient truth, try to miss the mark,
But we see through the veil, we're not alone,
Connected by wisdom that shakes the throne.

[Chorus]
We gather together, truth-seekers unite,
Sharing the knowledge hidden from sight,
Brothers and sisters who dare to see,
Kingdom fellowship sets us free.

[Verse 2]
They calculate scattering, measure the dome,
While we share discoveries, build our home,
Not fooling with dummies, we study it deep,
The secrets they buried, we no longer sleep.

[Chorus]
We gather together, truth-seekers unite,
Sharing the knowledge hidden from sight,
Brothers and sisters who dare to see,
Kingdom fellowship sets us free.

[Verse 3]
From USSR papers to firmament proof,
We compare the data, uncover the truth,
No longer divided, we stand as one,
Disciples together till the work is done.

[Chorus]
We gather together, truth-seekers unite,
Sharing the knowledge hidden from sight,
Brothers and sisters who dare to see,
Kingdom fellowship sets us free.

[Verse 4]
Optical thickness can't hide what's real,
The atmosphere's secrets begin to reveal,
We share every finding, we lift each voice,
In this community, we all rejoice.

[Bridge]
Iron sharpens iron, we make each other strong,
Walking in truth where we all belong,
Not scattered or lonely, but standing tall,
One body, one Spirit, we answer the call!

[Chorus]
We gather together, truth-seekers unite,
Sharing the knowledge hidden from sight,
Brothers and sisters who dare to see,
Kingdom fellowship sets us free.

[Outro]
Kingdom fellowship... where truth-seekers meet,
Standing together... our bond is complete.
