[Intro]
(Clock ticking, calendar pages)
The prophetic clock ticks...

[Verse 1]
Daniel saw the weeks of time
Seventy units in a rhyme
Sixty-nine have come and gone
The final week must carry on

[Chorus]
Daniel's seventy weeks are here
The tribulation drawing near
Seven years of hell on earth
The final act before rebirth
Daniel's seventy weeks

[Verse 2]
The prince who comes will make a deal
Seven years that feels unreal
Halfway through he breaks the pact
That's the final prophetic act

[Bridge]
Desolations are determined
Upon the holy and affirmed
Until the end that is decreed
Every prophecy indeed

[Chorus]
Daniel's seventy weeks are here
The tribulation drawing near
Seven years of hell on earth
The final act before rebirth
Daniel's seventy weeks

[Outro]
(Clock striking)
The time is near...
