[Intro]
(Unraveling sounds)
Everything you've built...

[Verse 1]
Everything will be undone
All that you have built and won
America's foundation cracks
Nothing holds, everything lacks

[Chorus]
Undone, everything undone
Under judgment's burning sun
What took centuries to make
Will collapse and finally break
Undone

[Verse 2]
Government systems fall apart
Rotten from the very start
Nothing works the way it should
Everything misunderstood

[Bridge]
The center will not hold together
Tearing in the stormy weather
What man built without the Lord
Collapses at His spoken word

[Chorus]
Undone, everything undone
Under judgment's burning sun
What took centuries to make
Will collapse and finally break
Undone

[Outro]
(Unraveling sounds completing)
It all comes undone...
