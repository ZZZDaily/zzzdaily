[Intro]
Why does everything cost more today?
There's a shadow industry making you pay

[Verse 1]
Middlemen controlling every price
Artificial scarcity, rolling the dice
Same corporations from farm to plate
Manipulating markets, sealing your fate

[Chorus]
Shadow industry driving up the food
Making sure you're always subdued
They control the prices, they control the supply
Working people struggle, billionaires fly high

[Verse 2]
Farms get paid pennies on the dollar
While the CEO loosens his collar
Subsidies going to the wrong hands
Small farmers losing their lands

[Bridge]
Kosher certification, another tax you pay
Hidden on every label every day
Pennies adding up to billions of gain
Secret economy, follow the chain

[Chorus]
Shadow industry driving up the food
Making sure you're always subdued
They control the prices, they control the supply
Working people struggle, billionaires fly high

[Outro]
Grow your own if you have the space
Get off the grid at your own pace
The system's designed to make you dependent
Breaking free is the first amendment
