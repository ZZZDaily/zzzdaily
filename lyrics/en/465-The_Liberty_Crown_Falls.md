[Intro]
(Statue sounds, then cracking)
I will break her crown...

[Verse 1]
Lady Liberty stands so proud
Her torch raised to the crowd
But God has said her crown will break
Judgment for freedom's sake

[Chorus]
The liberty crown falls tonight
Symbol of the coming blight
What America represented
Will be removed, tormented
Liberty falls

[Verse 2]
The Statue of Liberty will be struck
America's run out of luck
The crown upon her head will crack
Freedom never coming back

[Bridge]
What man builds up in pride
God can tear down from inside
Liberty was never free
Without God it cannot be

[Chorus]
The liberty crown falls tonight
Symbol of the coming blight
What America represented
Will be removed, tormented
Liberty falls

[Outro]
(Cracking sounds completing)
True freedom is in Christ...
