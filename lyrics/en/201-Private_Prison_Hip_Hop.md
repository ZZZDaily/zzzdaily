[Intro]
(Street beats, prison sounds)
In the early '90s a meeting took place
Hip-hop's direction set to embrace

[Verse 1]
Music executives gathered in a room
Told to change hip-hop's tune
From conscious to criminal, that was the shift
Private prison stocks about to lift
Investments in prisons needed inmates to fill
Hip-hop promoted content that would fit the bill

[Chorus]
Private prison hip-hop, engineering the fall
Music to incarcerate, heed the call
Private prison hip-hop, culture used as a weapon
Targeting the youth for the prison inception

[Verse 2]
Same networks that lifted Diddy up high
Had interests in seeing young Black men die
Or locked up for years, feeding the machine
Private prison hip-hop, dirtiest scheme
Destroy the community while making a profit
Private prison hip-hop, who would stop it?

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
They changed the music
To change the mind
Prison-industrial complex
Left truth behind

[Verse 3]
Whitney Webb exposed the connection clear
Private prison hip-hop, now we hear
The culture was captured for corporate gain
Private prison hip-hop, break the chain

[Outro]
(Beats and prison sounds merge, then silence)
Reclaim the culture from their prison plan
Private prison hip-hop, take a stand
