[Intro]
America's dad was something else
Behind the scenes he showed his true self

[Verse 1]
Three to four times a week at the mansion door
Hugh Hefner's best friend wanted more
Drugging women, leaving them in blood
Supreme Court let him walk through the mud

[Chorus]
Bill Cosby Playboy nights, cameras rolling
Every crime recorded, knowledge controlling
But the tapes are locked in some vault somewhere
Protection for the predator, justice unfair

[Verse 2]
Jim Brown cracking ribs in his wake
Roman Polanski, make no mistake
All at the mansion, protected friends
Blackmail ensures the party never ends

[Bridge]
Were they assets of the Agency too?
Protected operators doing what they do
The crimes mount up but nothing sticks
Same old playbook, same old tricks

[Chorus]
Bill Cosby Playboy nights, cameras rolling
Every crime recorded, knowledge controlling
But the tapes are locked in some vault somewhere
Protection for the predator, justice unfair

[Outro]
Hollywood is Babylon, make no mistake
Every star has got a take
Compromised and controlled from day one
Welcome to the business, having fun?
