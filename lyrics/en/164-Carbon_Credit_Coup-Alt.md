[Intro]
(Acoustic guitar, environmental soundscape)
They're monetizing nature, putting Earth up for sale
Carbon credit schemes, a banker's fairytale

[Verse 1]
GREEN+ program spreading through Latin America's land
Satellogic satellites, surveillance from intelligence command
Steven Mnuchin, Howard Lutnick, on the board they sit
Watching every forest, every jungle bit
Cercarbono blockchain tracking carbon units sold
Turning trees and rivers into digital gold

[Chorus]
Carbon credit coup, stealing nature's worth
Elite financiers colonizing Earth
Carbon credit coup, debt from above
Using climate fear to strip what we love

[Verse 2]
Natural Asset Corporations, NACs they're called
Rockefeller Foundation got the plan installed
Take the commons, forests, rivers, lakes galore
Sell them off to Wall Street, that's what they're for
BlackRock tokenizing Amazon's lungs
New form of digital gold when the old one's done

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
They say it's to save the planet
Conservation's the game
But it's financial colonization
Just by another name

[Verse 3]
Mark Carney pushing it, the junk bond kings return
Using nature as collateral while the forests burn
Whitney Webb and Mark Goodwin blew the whistle loud
Carbon credit coup beneath the carbon cloud

[Outro]
(Guitar fades with nature sounds)
The Amazon is not for sale, neither are we
Carbon credit coup, time to set nature free
