[Intro]
(Old Hollywood sound, spy theme)
Music Corporation of America, MCA the name
Entertainment and intelligence, one and the same

[Verse 1]
Lew Wasserman ran the show for decades long
MOB connections, government, all along
Jules Stein founded it, talent agency first
Then expanded to movies, the empire burst
FOIA documents reveal what they hid
MCA spook records, intelligence amid

[Chorus]
MCA spook records, entertainment's cover
Intelligence operations, one under the other
MCA spook records, from the very start
Music, movies, media playing the part

[Verse 2]
From MCA came Arista, Clive Davis too
The networks that lifted Diddy right on cue
Andre Harrell, Russell Simmons, Bad Boy began
MCA spook records, that was the plan
Control the culture, shape what people hear
MCA spook records, engineering fear

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Hollywood and Langley
Always walked as one
Entertainment propaganda
Since the business begun

[Verse 3]
Whitney Webb connected music to the intelligence game
MCA spook records, always the same
From hip-hop to movies, the networks persist
MCA spook records, making the list

[Outro]
(Hollywood sound fades)
Question what you're fed through the entertainment screen
MCA spook records, not what they seem
