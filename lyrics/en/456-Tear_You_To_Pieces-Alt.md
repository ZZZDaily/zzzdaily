[Intro]
(Violent sounds)
They're coming for you...

[Verse 1]
God said they will tear you apart
Those who've got an evil heart
Persecutors of the saints
Coming without any restraints

[Chorus]
They will tear you to pieces today
For refusing to obey
The beast system's dark command
But Jesus holds you in His hand
They will tear

[Verse 2]
Violence against the pure
Those who stand and who endure
Hated for the Savior's name
But Jesus covers all the shame

[Bridge]
Fear not those who kill the body
The soul they cannot harm
The one who holds your eternal arm
Is mightier than any army

[Chorus]
They will tear you to pieces today
For refusing to obey
The beast system's dark command
But Jesus holds you in His hand
They will tear

[Outro]
(Violence fading to peace)
Fear not...
