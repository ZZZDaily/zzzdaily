[Intro]
The women's movement wasn't grassroots, friend
CIA operations from beginning to the end

[Verse 1]
Gloria Steinem, Playboy bunny spy
Working for the Agency, nobody asked why
Ms. Magazine, funded by the state
Breaking up the family, that's their fate

[Chorus]
Gloria Steinem CIA on the payroll
Feminism weaponized, taking its toll
Divide the family, women against man
Population control, that was the plan

[Verse 2]
Women in the workforce, double the tax
Latchkey kids, parenting lacks
Who raised the children while mom was at work?
Television programming with a smirk

[Bridge]
Not about equality, never was
It's about destruction of what once was
The nuclear family was their enemy
Breaking bonds to set the slaves free... for them

[Chorus]
Gloria Steinem CIA on the payroll
Feminism weaponized, taking its toll
Divide the family, women against man
Population control, that was the plan

[Outro]
Real women's rights are worth the fight
But the movement was hijacked in the night
Know the history of who led the way
Question everything that experts say
