[Intro]
(Disease sounds, medical)
The consequence of sin...

[Verse 1]
Romans one makes clear the cost
Of those in sexual sin lost
Receiving in themselves the pay
The penalty comes either way

[Chorus]
The penalty of error in the flesh
Disease and plague, a wicked mesh
Men with men receiving due
Women burning through and through
The penalty of error

[Verse 2]
God gave them over to their lust
Now their bodies turn to dust
Diseases that cannot be cured
Because His warning was ignored

[Bridge]
Strange flesh brings a heavy price
Sin is never worth the vice
The body pays for the soul's sin
This is where the plagues begin

[Chorus]
The penalty of error in the flesh
Disease and plague, a wicked mesh
Men with men receiving due
Women burning through and through
The penalty of error

[Outro]
(Medical sounds fading)
Turn from sin...
