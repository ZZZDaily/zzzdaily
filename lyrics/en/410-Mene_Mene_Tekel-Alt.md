[Intro]
(Writing on wall sounds)
The handwriting appears...

[Verse 1]
A hand appeared upon the wall
Writing words to make kings fall
Mene Mene Tekel Parsin
Your kingdom's days are thin

[Chorus]
Mene Mene Tekel Upharsin
Weighed and found wanting within
Numbered, numbered, your days are done
Given to others, your kingdom's gone
Mene Mene Tekel

[Verse 2]
That very night Belshazzar died
Daniel's words were not denied
America sees the same tonight
The writing glowing in the light

[Bridge]
You have been weighed on heaven's scale
Your righteousness is paper frail
The kingdom given to your foes
This is how the story goes

[Chorus]
Mene Mene Tekel Upharsin
Weighed and found wanting within
Numbered, numbered, your days are done
Given to others, your kingdom's gone
Mene Mene Tekel

[Outro]
(Writing sounds fading)
Read the writing...
