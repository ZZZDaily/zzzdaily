[Intro]
(Roosters fighting, political sounds)
America divided...

[Verse 1]
Two roosters in a ring of hate
Fighting for the United States
Red and blue at each other's throat
Neither one can save the boat

[Chorus]
The cockfight rages on and on
Until the nation is undone
Division by design you see
This is how they destroy thee
The cockfight

[Verse 2]
While the chickens peck and fight
Enemies move in the night
So distracted by your wars
You don't see who's at your doors

[Bridge]
United we stand, divided we fall
The oldest trick of them all
Keep the people fighting here
While the real threat draws near

[Chorus]
The cockfight rages on and on
Until the nation is undone
Division by design you see
This is how they destroy thee
The cockfight

[Outro]
(Fighting sounds fading)
Stop fighting each other...
