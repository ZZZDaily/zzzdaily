[Intro]
(Chaotic sounds, shouting)
Insanity grips the land...

[Verse 1]
America's lost her mind tonight
Nothing left that's good or right
Madness spreading through the streets
Every person that you meet

[Chorus]
A people of madness rising up
Drinking from a poisoned cup
Sanity has left the land
No one seems to understand
A people of madness

[Verse 2]
Logic fails, reason's gone
Darkness takes them one by one
What was obvious now denied
Truth has been crucified

[Bridge]
A strong delusion sent by God
For those who rejected the rod
They refused to love the truth
So lies become their proof

[Chorus]
A people of madness rising up
Drinking from a poisoned cup
Sanity has left the land
No one seems to understand
A people of madness

[Outro]
(Chaotic sounds fading)
Love the truth...
