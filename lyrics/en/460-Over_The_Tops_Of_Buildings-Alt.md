[Intro]
(Water rushing upward)
Higher and higher...

[Verse 1]
I saw the water rise so high
Over building tops to the sky
New York sinking beneath the waves
Finding watery graves

[Chorus]
Over the tops of buildings tall
The waters rise, covering all
What was built so proud and high
Drowning under the sky
Over the tops

[Verse 2]
Skyscrapers disappear from view
Nothing anyone can do
The flood consumes the city whole
Taking every single soul

[Bridge]
God's judgment cannot be escaped
No matter how the city's shaped
What rises high in pride must fall
Waters rising over all

[Chorus]
Over the tops of buildings tall
The waters rise, covering all
What was built so proud and high
Drowning under the sky
Over the tops

[Outro]
(Water sounds completing)
Flee the city...
