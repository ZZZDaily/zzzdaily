[Intro]
(Unsettling electronic tones)
Hiding in plain sight...

[Verse 1]
They look like us but something's wrong
Their eyes are empty all day long
Shapeshifters walking city streets
Serpent people who you meet

[Chorus]
Humanoids among us every day
Reptilian beings in human clay
Nephilim seed in modern times
Hiding their nature, hiding their crimes
Humanoids among us

[Verse 2]
I saw a man with teeth too long
Eye teeth sharpened, something wrong
The Lord said look away from him
A shapeshifter wearing human skin

[Bridge]
They've been among us for centuries
Perfecting their appearances
Satan's children looking like you
Wolves in sheep's clothing breaking through

[Chorus]
Humanoids among us every day
Reptilian beings in human clay
Nephilim seed in modern times
Hiding their nature, hiding their crimes
Humanoids among us

[Outro]
(Fading disturbing tones)
Eyes to see... ears to hear...
