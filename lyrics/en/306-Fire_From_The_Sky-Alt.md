[Intro]
(Roaring flames, aerial sounds)
Fallout from a thousand weapons...

[Verse 1]
Multiple cities hit at once
America pays for all her stunts
Fire from the sky descends
This is how the empire ends

[Chorus]
Fire from the sky rains down tonight
God's judgment burns so very bright
The smoke of Babylon seen afar
Where merchants weep for the fallen star
Fire from the sky

[Verse 2]
Sudden attack without a warning
America won't see another morning
Everything you built in pride
Burning, burning, none can hide

[Bridge]
The architects of your demise
Were in your midst before your eyes
Treachery from within your gates
Sealing your determined fate

[Chorus]
Fire from the sky rains down tonight
God's judgment burns so very bright
The smoke of Babylon seen afar
Where merchants weep for the fallen star
Fire from the sky

[Outro]
(Flames crackling, fading)
It comes without warning...
