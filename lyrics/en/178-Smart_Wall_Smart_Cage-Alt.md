[Intro]
(Acoustic guitar, desert wind)
They argue about the wall, should it be built or not
But the smart wall surveillance is what they really got

[Verse 1]
Manufacturing consent for the border fiasco show
While the real agenda sneaks in down below
Biometric surveillance towers spanning every mile
Facial recognition capturing every single file
It's not about stopping immigrants, that's just the bait
Smart wall technology testing a bigger fate

[Chorus]
Smart wall, smart cage, surveillance either way
It doesn't matter who gets in, we all will pay
Smart wall, smart cage, the border's just the start
They're building the infrastructure to monitor every heart

[Verse 2]
Palantir has the contracts, ICE and DHS
The same tech they're testing will spread to all the rest
Digital ID checkpoints coming to every town
Smart wall technology making its way around
They want you fighting left vs right over immigration
While they build the surveillance for the whole nation

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
The wall isn't for outsiders
That's what they want you to think
The cage is being built around
All of us, link by link

[Verse 3]
Whitney Webb exposed it, the border is a lab
Testing smart wall tech before the final grab
Smart wall smart cage, now you understand
Surveillance is the goal across the land

[Outro]
(Guitar fades with wind)
Don't fall for the distraction of the immigration fight
Smart wall smart cage keeps everyone in sight
