[Intro]
(Rain and thunder)
The water rises like a pencil...

[Verse 1]
Statue of Liberty crowned with pride
I will break her crown, God prophesied
The great city built upon the coast
Soon to become a watery ghost

[Chorus]
New York will drown in the coming tide
Waters rise from every side
Over the tops of buildings tall
The bloody city's final fall
New York will drown

[Verse 2]
Wall Street towers reaching high
Will fill with water from the sky
The Tyre of the modern age
Written upon God's final page

[Bridge]
From underground the waters come
Flooding tunnels one by one
Sign in the sky, arrows fall
God has written on your wall

[Chorus]
New York will drown in the coming tide
Waters rise from every side
Over the tops of buildings tall
The bloody city's final fall
New York will drown

[Outro]
(Fading storm sounds)
Flee the city... flee...
