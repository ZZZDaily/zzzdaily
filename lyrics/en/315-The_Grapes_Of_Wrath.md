[Intro]
(Thunderous wine press sounds)
The winepress of God's fury...

[Verse 1]
The cup is filled and overflowing
Seeds of wickedness are growing
God's patience has an ending date
America, it's almost too late

[Chorus]
The grapes of wrath are fully grown
The harvest comes for seeds you've sown
Blood up to the horses' bridles
A judgment no one can hide from
The grapes of wrath

[Verse 2]
Revelation shows the hour
When God displays His awesome power
The nations gathered, grapes are pressed
Babylon faces her final test

[Bridge]
Who can stand when He appears?
Who survives these final years?
Only those in Jesus' name
Who never bring the Lord to shame

[Chorus]
The grapes of wrath are fully grown
The harvest comes for seeds you've sown
Blood up to the horses' bridles
A judgment no one can hide from
The grapes of wrath

[Outro]
(Thunder fading)
The harvest is ripe...
