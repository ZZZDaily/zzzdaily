[Intro]
(Tank treads, military vehicles)
Foreign armor on American soil...

[Verse 1]
I saw them rolling down the street
Foreign soldiers at their feet
Chinese tanks, Russian troops
America in endless loops

[Chorus]
Tanks in America tonight
The invasion at first light
What was unthinkable now is real
Under iron tracks you kneel
Tanks in America

[Verse 2]
The flag comes down, a new one raised
The conquerors stand there amazed
At how easily she fell
America's road to hell

[Bridge]
While you argued left and right
The enemy prepared to fight
United they came for you
Now there's nothing you can do

[Chorus]
Tanks in America tonight
The invasion at first light
What was unthinkable now is real
Under iron tracks you kneel
Tanks in America

[Outro]
(Tank sounds fading)
It's coming... prepare...
