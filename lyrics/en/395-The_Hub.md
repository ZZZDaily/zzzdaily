[Intro]
(Intelligence gathering sounds)
The center of espionage...

[Verse 1]
Russia will become the hub
Where all intelligence does rub
Spying operations based
America displaced

[Chorus]
The hub of darkness in the north
Russia sending armies forth
Intelligence and power combined
America far behind
The hub

[Verse 2]
What America once possessed
Russia now does far the best
Every secret, every spy
Under Putin's watchful eye

[Bridge]
The tables turn, the mighty fall
Russia answers when they call
What was yours is theirs tonight
Transferred in the cover of night

[Chorus]
The hub of darkness in the north
Russia sending armies forth
Intelligence and power combined
America far behind
The hub

[Outro]
(Intelligence sounds fading)
Power shifts...
