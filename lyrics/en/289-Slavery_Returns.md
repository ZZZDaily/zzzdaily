[Intro]
(Chains rattling, work songs)
America in chains...

[Verse 1]
The slavery chronicles unfold again
Americans become the slaves of foreign men
Russia and China divide the spoils
Taking Americans for their endless toils

[Chorus]
Slavery returns to American shores
What you did to others now is yours
Chains on wrists and chains on feet
History and judgment meet
Slavery returns

[Verse 2]
Sent for their flesh the council said
American bodies, living or dead
Labor demands from rising powers
America's final dying hours

[Bridge]
Buffalo soldiers once you employed
Now your own people deployed
Every whip that cracked on Black skin
Comes back around again

[Chorus]
Slavery returns to American shores
What you did to others now is yours
Chains on wrists and chains on feet
History and judgment meet
Slavery returns

[Outro]
(Chains fading)
What you sow you reap...
