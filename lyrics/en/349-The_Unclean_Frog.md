[Intro]
(Frog croaking, unsettling)
The vaccine that sheds...

[Verse 1]
God showed an unclean frog to me
A creature of perversity
It sheds its poison all around
Infecting without a sound

[Chorus]
The unclean frog that sheds and spreads
Marking victims as it treads
You don't need the needle's prick
Exposure makes you just as sick
The unclean frog

[Verse 2]
Those who took it shed on you
Spike proteins breaking through
Contact with the vaccinated
Leaves you just as contaminated

[Bridge]
The frog spirits of Revelation
Gathering for the final station
Unclean spirits from the beast
Gathering all for the feast

[Chorus]
The unclean frog that sheds and spreads
Marking victims as it treads
You don't need the needle's prick
Exposure makes you just as sick
The unclean frog

[Outro]
(Frog sounds fading)
Guard yourself...
