[Intro]
Started asking questions, ended up down deep
The rabbit hole had secrets it could barely keep

[Verse 1]
Two percent the population, look at what they hold
Media, banking, politicians sold
Anomaly statistics everywhere you look
Not hate speech to read what's in the book

[Chorus]
Down the rabbi hole, the investigation goes
Following the money, everyone knows
Facts aren't bigotry when they can be proved
Patterns emerge when the veil is removed

[Verse 2]
Hollywood, music, pharmaceutical too
Same small group running the whole crew
Call it names, try to shut it down
But the researchers keep digging around

[Bridge]
Not all are guilty, most are just people
But those at the top pull strings from the steeple
Using their own as a human shield
While their crimes remain concealed

[Chorus]
Down the rabbi hole, the investigation goes
Following the money, everyone knows
Facts aren't bigotry when they can be proved
Patterns emerge when the veil is removed

[Outro]
Keep asking questions, don't accept the frame
Every empire plays the same old game
Truth will set you free when you know who's who
Even when they try to silence you
