[Intro]
(Capitol sounds, digital bleeps)
GENIUS Act passed with bipartisan support
PayPal Mafia's decades of effort, report

[Verse 1]
Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins
The acronym hides what the bill enjoins
Thiel and friends have waited for this day
Legal framework for their digital sway
Stablecoins legitimized, under their control
GENIUS Act accomplishing the goal

[Chorus]
GENIUS Act takeover, hiding in plain sight
Legislation drafted by those with the might
GENIUS Act takeover, they wrote the rules
Making us all their digital fools

[Verse 2]
PayPal Presidency culmination right here
Every bill they wanted, finally clear
Financial surveillance infrastructure complete
GENIUS Act takeover, tasting their treat
The Democrats and Republicans all agreed
GENIUS Act serving the corporate creed

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
They write the laws themselves
Then lobby them through
GENIUS Act shows
What money can do

[Verse 3]
Whitney Webb and Mark Goodwin warned us loud
GENIUS Act takeover, the corporate crowd
Don't celebrate the crypto regulation win
GENIUS Act takeover lets the wolves in

[Outro]
(Sounds fade to silence)
Question every bill that passes through the night
GENIUS Act takeover, join the fight
