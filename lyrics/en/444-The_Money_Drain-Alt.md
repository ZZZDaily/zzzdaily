[Intro]
(Water draining sounds)
Money down the drain...

[Verse 1]
All your wealth is draining fast
Nothing built to really last
Economic systems fail
America beneath the veil

[Chorus]
Money down the drain tonight
Savings vanish from your sight
What you worked for, what you saved
Gone like water in a wave
Money down the drain

[Verse 2]
Inflation eating through the wealth
Stealing purchasing power stealth
What cost one now costs ten
The crash of markets yet again

[Bridge]
Put not your trust in silver, gold
These things get bought and sold
Store your treasure up in heaven
The only wealth truly given

[Chorus]
Money down the drain tonight
Savings vanish from your sight
What you worked for, what you saved
Gone like water in a wave
Money down the drain

[Outro]
(Draining sounds completing)
Invest in eternity...
