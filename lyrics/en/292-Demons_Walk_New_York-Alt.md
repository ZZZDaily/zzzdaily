[Intro]
(City ambience, unsettling)
The army of the possessed...

[Verse 1]
Demonized people walk the streets tonight
Some wear suits, some out of sight
Empty eyes with no one home
Just the demon walking alone

[Chorus]
Demons walk New York City tonight
Hidden in plain, visible sight
Talking to things we cannot see
Pointing at you and at me
Demons walk New York

[Verse 2]
Lurching, stumbling, sudden moves
Speaking gibberish in evil grooves
Satan infiltrating warm bodies here
An army growing year by year

[Bridge]
When things come through that are not of God
These vessels will accept the facade
First to notice shifts in the air
First to serve what's waiting there

[Chorus]
Demons walk New York City tonight
Hidden in plain, visible sight
Talking to things we cannot see
Pointing at you and at me
Demons walk New York

[Outro]
(City sounds fading)
The city is full of them...
