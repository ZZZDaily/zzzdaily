[Intro]
(Church bells, then thunder)
Turn from your wicked ways...

[Verse 1]
Sixty-four million babies dead
More than Hitler ever spread
Abortion altars sacrifice
And still you think you'll pay no price?

[Chorus]
Repent America while there's time
Turn away from every crime
God will not be mocked by men
This is the hour to repent
Repent America

[Verse 2]
Sexual sin flooding every shore
Sodom's children wanting more
Drag queens teaching little kids
Nothing holy, nothing hid

[Bridge]
The prayers for America God won't hear
He's made His judgment crystal clear
Unless individuals turn and pray
There is no other way

[Chorus]
Repent America while there's time
Turn away from every crime
God will not be mocked by men
This is the hour to repent
Repent America

[Outro]
(Thunder fading to soft prayer)
Repent... before it's too late...
