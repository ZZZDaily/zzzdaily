[Intro]
(Piano, building intensity)
Billionaires meet in secret, power beyond measure
Mega Group gathering to protect their treasure

[Verse 1]
Leslie Wexner, Charles Bronfman, founding members strong
Media, retail, spirits, list goes on and on
Lauder, Spielberg, financiers of every kind
Intelligence connections leaving trails behind
Jeffrey Epstein funded through this network wide
Mega Group mafia with nowhere to hide

[Chorus]
Mega Group mafia, oligarchs unite
Controlling from the shadows, hidden from the light
Mega Group mafia, their names we need to know
The puppet masters pulling strings from down below

[Verse 2]
From Wexner's fortune, Epstein got his start
Limited Brands and Victoria's Secret, just the art
Bronfman liquor dynasty with NXIVM ties
Mega Group mafia behind the greatest lies
They fund the politicians, both parties owned
Mega Group mafia, sitting on the throne

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
When billionaires conspire
In meetings closed to all
The rest of us just wonder
Who answers when they call

[Verse 3]
Whitney Webb exposed the network piece by piece
Mega Group mafia, will they ever cease?
Know their names, follow the money trail
Mega Group mafia, time to lift the veil

[Outro]
(Piano resolves dramatically)
Shine light on the shadows where the power hides
Mega Group mafia, no more place to ride
