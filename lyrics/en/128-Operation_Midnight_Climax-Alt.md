[Intro]
San Francisco, nineteen fifty-four
CIA brothels, hidden behind the door

[Verse 1]
Sidney Gottlieb orchestrating tests
Drugging men with LSD, among the rest
Subliminal messages, criminal commands
Programming assassins with their own hands

[Chorus]
Operation Midnight Climax in the night
Hidden cameras capturing every sight
Blackmail operations, leverage gained
Nobody remembers, their memory stained

[Verse 2]
Same year Playboy hit the stands
MKUltra spreading across the lands
Brothels multiplied from coast to coast
The men with power hurt people the most

[Bridge]
They say they stopped in sixty-five
But the Playboy empire stayed alive
Same tactics, different name
Continuous operation, identical game

[Chorus]
Operation Midnight Climax in the night
Hidden cameras capturing every sight
Blackmail operations, leverage gained
Nobody remembers, their memory stained

[Outro]
When they tell you that they stopped a program
That's usually when they really began
Underground, the darkness grows
Until a whistleblower finally knows
