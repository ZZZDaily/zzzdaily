[Intro]
(Dark, tense music)
19 minutes to human trafficking...

[Verse 1]
Children disappearing in the night
A crime that's hidden from the light
Elite networks trading souls of men
America you harbor this great sin

[Chorus]
Human trafficking nation, blood on your hands
Children sold across all your lands
The saints cry out from underneath the altar
When will You repay, when will You falter?
Human trafficking nation

[Verse 2]
They take them from the grocery store
From schools, from neighborhoods next door
A network so vast and so protected
By those you've trusted and elected

[Bridge]
The blood of innocents cries from the ground
America, can you hear the sound?
Every child that's bought and sold
A debt unpaid a thousandfold

[Chorus]
Human trafficking nation, blood on your hands
Children sold across all your lands
The saints cry out from underneath the altar
When will You repay, when will You falter?
Human trafficking nation

[Outro]
(Fading dark music)
Justice comes... justice comes...
