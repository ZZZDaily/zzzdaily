[Intro]
(Industrial sounds, marching)
Corporate monopolies backed by state might
Techno-fascism rising in plain sight

[Verse 1]
It's not libertarianism gone astray
Techno-fascism rising, seize the day
Private tyranny with government power
Techno-fascism rising every hour
Silicon Valley and the national security state
Techno-fascism rising, sealed our fate?

[Chorus]
Techno-fascism rising, control's new face
Digital totalitarianism in every place
Techno-fascism rising, corporate state merged
Freedom drowned as surveillance surged

[Verse 2]
Thiel and Musk, saviors or the jailers?
Techno-fascism rising, never failures
Free speech rhetoric while building the cage
Techno-fascism rising, turn the page
Financial compliance, speech monitored tight
Techno-fascism rising through the night

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Left and right
Miss the point
Techno-fascism
Out of joint
With everything we valued
Or thought we knew
Techno-fascism coming
For me and you

[Verse 3]
Whitney Webb has named what others won't
Techno-fascism rising, but we don't
Have to accept it, we can still resist
Techno-fascism rising, get the gist

[Outro]
(Industrial fades to human sounds)
Build alternatives outside their grip
Techno-fascism rising, don't let it trip
Your spirit, your freedom, your humanity
Techno-fascism rising meets its enemy: we
