[Intro]
(Ticking clock, urgency)
Time is running out...

[Verse 1]
Everything I've told you is near
Closer than you think or fear
Not generations from today
These things happen in your day

[Chorus]
Closer than you think they come
Judgments falling one by one
Not your grandchildren's concern
You will see, you will learn
Closer than you think

[Verse 2]
The signs are all around you now
Every warning shows you how
This generation sees it all
The rise, the judgment, and the fall

[Bridge]
Do not say it's far away
These prophecies are for today
Prepare your heart, prepare your soul
Time to let the Lord take control

[Chorus]
Closer than you think they come
Judgments falling one by one
Not your grandchildren's concern
You will see, you will learn
Closer than you think

[Outro]
(Clock ticking intensifying)
Now is the time...
