[Intro]
(Russian anthem style music)
Russia will be the mirror...

[Verse 1]
Mirror mirror on the wall
Who's the fairest of them all?
Russia rises, America falls
Putin answering history's calls

[Chorus]
Mirror mirror, Russia reflects
Everything America projects
Every evil you have done
Comes back on you through Russia's gun
Mirror mirror

[Verse 2]
A renaissance for Russia comes
While America succumbs
Popular democracy they'll embrace
Taking over America's place

[Bridge]
Putin will feed many nations
Providing better foundations
With a fairer, steadier hand
Than Babylon's crumbling sand

[Chorus]
Mirror mirror, Russia reflects
Everything America projects
Every evil you have done
Comes back on you through Russia's gun
Mirror mirror

[Outro]
(Russian anthem fading)
The fairest of them all...
