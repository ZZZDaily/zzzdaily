[Intro]
Nineteen seventy-three they said they shut it down
But the program just went deeper underground

[Verse 1]
Sidney Gottlieb running torture tests
Sleep deprivation, trauma manifest
Children molested in the name of science
Rockefeller money funding the alliance

[Chorus]
MKUltra never ended, it just changed its name
From the boardroom to the bedroom, it's the same sick game
Breaking minds and building slaves for the elite
Programming the masses to accept defeat

[Verse 2]
Playboy launched the same year they began
Shadow mansions all across the land
Drugging, filming, building leverage files
Blackmail operations stretching miles and miles

[Bridge]
When Congress investigated what'd they find?
Nelson Rockefeller leading the blind
Whitewashed report with national security claims
All the evidence burned, playing their games

[Chorus]
MKUltra never ended, it just changed its name
From the boardroom to the bedroom, it's the same sick game
Breaking minds and building slaves for the elite
Programming the masses to accept defeat

[Outro]
Turn off your television, reject their programming
The mind control continues, they're still scamming
Your thoughts are not your own if you don't fight
Wake up from the hypnosis, step into the light
