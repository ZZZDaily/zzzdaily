[Intro]
(Subway sounds, then rumbling)
Something rises from below...

[Verse 1]
The underground of New York City
Hides something less than pretty
Creatures dwelling in the deep
Where the sewer waters seep

[Chorus]
From underground they will rise
A terrible and dark surprise
Creatures dwelling in the dark
Coming up to make their mark
From underground

[Verse 2]
New York has no idea what lives
Down where the subway gives
Access to another realm
Something dark at the helm

[Bridge]
The homeless demonized already know
They feel the shifts below
When portals open underground
Strange beings will abound

[Chorus]
From underground they will rise
A terrible and dark surprise
Creatures dwelling in the dark
Coming up to make their mark
From underground

[Outro]
(Rumbling fading)
Something stirs below...
