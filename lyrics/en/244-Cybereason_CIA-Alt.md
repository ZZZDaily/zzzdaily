[Intro]
(Cybersecurity sounds, intelligence ambience)
Cybereason, a company you should know
CIA and Mossad connections in tow

[Verse 1]
Satellogic board connections, the surveillance spreads
Cybereason CIA, filling heads
Israeli Unit 8200 veterans found it
Cybereason CIA, intelligence surrounded
Cybersecurity company with deep state ties
Cybereason CIA, open your eyes

[Chorus]
Cybereason CIA, watching from inside
Cybersecurity cover, nothing to hide
Cybereason CIA, protecting or surveilling?
When intelligence funds it, truth is failing

[Verse 2]
Softbank invested, connections grow wide
Cybereason CIA, worldwide
From endpoint protection to data collection
Cybereason CIA, detection
Or is it surveillance by another name?
Cybereason CIA, the same game

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
When spies build companies
For cybersecurity's sake
Who are they protecting?
What's really at stake?

[Verse 3]
Whitney Webb listed them in the surveillance web
Cybereason CIA, from whom we fled
Know the companies watching your digital life
Cybereason CIA, cutting like a knife

[Outro]
(Cyber sounds fade)
True security doesn't need intelligence ties
Cybereason CIA, see through their guise
