[Intro]
(Triumphant horns, building)
Look up, your redemption draws near...

[Verse 1]
Through all the darkness I have shown
One truth stands firmly known
Jesus Christ is coming back
Nothing that the world can lack

[Chorus]
Jesus is coming soon, so soon
Under the blood red moon
Every prophecy points to Him
The Bright and Morning Star within
Jesus is coming soon

[Verse 2]
The wars, the plagues, the pain, the strife
All lead to eternal life
For those who hold onto His name
Victory in Jesus' name

[Bridge]
Don't lose heart at what you see
This is how it has to be
The birth pangs of a world reborn
After the darkest night comes morn

[Chorus]
Jesus is coming soon, so soon
Under the blood red moon
Every prophecy points to Him
The Bright and Morning Star within
Jesus is coming soon

[Outro]
(Triumphant conclusion)
Maranatha, come Lord Jesus!
Even so, come quickly!
Amen!
