SONG 7: "Ancient Documents"
(Theme: A mysterious investigation into classified files, redacted truths, and what governments may know but won't reveal.)


[Intro]

[Verse 1]
They declassify what they want you to see,
NASA memorandums from Langley DC,
Technical papers with words they can't hide,
Flat non-rotating Earth buried inside.

[Chorus]
Read the documents, the truth's in the files,
They've been lying to your face all the while,
Equations don't match what they show on TV,
Open your eyes and you might just be free.

[Verse 2]
Freedom of Information, they hand you the proof,
Radar data and angles, they can't hide the truth,
Washington offices, Houston's a show,
The headquarters knows things you're not meant to know.

[Chorus]
Read the documents, the truth's in the files,
They've been lying to your face all the while,
Equations don't match what they show on TV,
Open your eyes and you might just be free.

[Verse 3]
Derivation equations for aircraft in flight,
Assumptions they make hidden in plain sight,
Over a flat non-rotating plane,
Six degrees of freedom, it's all in the name.

[Chorus]
Read the documents, the truth's in the files,
They've been lying to your face all the while,
Equations don't match what they show on TV,
Open your eyes and you might just be free.

[Verse 4]
From NASA dot gov, it's all certified real,
Langley Research telling you the deal,
Not just one paper, there's hundreds to find,
A flat Earth foundation in every design.

[Bridge]
They teach you a globe since you're five years old,
But their own documents tell a story untold,
Technical manuals don't need to deceive,
The engineers write what they truly believe.

[Chorus]
Read the documents, the truth's in the files,
They've been lying to your face all the while,
Equations don't match what they show on TV,
Open your eyes and you might just be free.

[Outro]
Ancient documents... the truth's in the files,
Open your eyes... see through the lies.
