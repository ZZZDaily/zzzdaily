[Intro]
Buildings buried to the windows, streets underground
What happened to our history that can't be found?

[Verse 1]
First floors became basements overnight
Cities buried in the mud without a fight
Abandoned buildings with the dinner on the stove
Someone had to flee, but where'd they go?

[Chorus]
The mud flood covered up the world we knew
Advanced civilization that they hid from view
Wikipedia says these ruins don't exist
But old newspapers, they persist

[Verse 2]
Four hundred rooms under one roof found
In New Mexico buried in the ground
Smithsonian collected everything they saw
Then locked it in the basement, what's the flaw?

[Bridge]
Frequency weapons liquefied the soil
Erased the old world after all their toil
Or maybe something else we can't explain
Either way our history's gone down the drain

[Chorus]
The mud flood covered up the world we knew
Advanced civilization that they hid from view
Wikipedia says these ruins don't exist
But old newspapers, they persist

[Outro]
Tartaria, that's the name they gave
To the empire buried in its grave
Was it natural or was it made?
Either way someone got paid
