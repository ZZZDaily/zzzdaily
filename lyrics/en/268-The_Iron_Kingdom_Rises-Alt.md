[Intro]
(Industrial mechanical sounds)
Iron and clay shall not cleave...

[Verse 1]
Daniel saw a kingdom made of mixed debris
Iron legs with feet of clay for all to see
Not Rome, not China, something far more strange
Humanity combined with things that rearrange

[Chorus]
The iron kingdom rises from the earth
Transhumanism, a demonic birth
Metal and flesh that cannot bind
The last kingdom of mankind
The iron kingdom rises

[Verse 2]
Bionic arms and chips inside your brain
Accept the mods and you are never God's again
They try to mingle with the seed of men
But iron and clay can never blend

[Bridge]
If you add pieces to yourself
Connected to AI's shelf
God said to tell you plainly clear
His kingdom you will never near

[Chorus]
The iron kingdom rises from the earth
Transhumanism, a demonic birth
Metal and flesh that cannot bind
The last kingdom of mankind
The iron kingdom rises

[Outro]
(Mechanical sounds fading)
Stay fully human... stay human...
