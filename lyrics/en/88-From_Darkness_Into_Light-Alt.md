SONG 10: "From Darkness Into Light"
(Theme: A conversion story of transformation from alcoholism, agnosticism, and despair into faith and newfound purpose.)

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I was drowning in the bottle, lost in the night,
Agnostic and alone, no hope in sight,
Empty promises and a hollow chest,
Running from the pain, never finding rest.

[Chorus]
From darkness into light, I found my way,
Jesus broke my chains, turned night to day,
No more wandering blind, no more despair,
I'm lifted from the pit by the power of prayer.

[Verse 2]
I believed their lies, drank their poison down,
Numbing all the ache in this broken town,
Flat earth, flat life, spinning out of control,
A mathematical equation with no soul.

[Chorus]
From darkness into light, I found my way,
Jesus broke my chains, turned night to day,
No more wandering blind, no more despair,
I'm lifted from the pit by the power of prayer.

[Verse 3]
They said "just trust the science, trust what we say,"
But their formulas were built on ground of clay,
Flat assumptions, rotating lies they teach,
The truth was always there, but out of reach.

[Verse 4]
Then the scales fell off and I could see,
The King of Kings reached down and set me free,
From the bottle to the Bible, death to life,
He took my chaos and He ended my strife.

[Bridge]
No more helicopter waiting on the spin,
No more drowning in my whiskey and my sin,
The earth stands still beneath my solid feet,
And Christ's love made this broken man complete.

[Chorus]
From darkness into light, I found my way,
Jesus broke my chains, turned night to day,
No more wandering blind, no more despair,
I'm lifted from the pit by the power of prayer.

[Outro]
From darkness into light... Jesus made me whole,
He rescued this lost, agnostic soul.
