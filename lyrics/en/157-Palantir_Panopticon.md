[Intro]
(Heavy bass synth, surveillance beeps)
Peter Thiel built a machine to see it all
From PayPal to Palantir, watching every call

[Verse 1]
CIA seed money, that's how it began
In-Q-Tel investment for the surveillance plan
Two hundred visits to Langley in the early days
Palantir engineers learning spook-craft ways
Total Information Awareness, Congress shut it down
But it lives on in private, wearing a corporate gown

[Chorus]
Palantir panopticon, watching every move
Tracking all your data, they got nothing left to prove
Palantir panopticon, pre-crime algorithm dreams
Nothing is private in their surveillance schemes

[Verse 2]
From border enforcement to predictive police
Palantir's tentacles reach, they'll never cease
Ukraine and Gaza, their AI tools deploy
Targeting humans like they're just a toy
Thiel funds politicians, J.D. Vance in his grip
PayPal mafia steering the ship

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
They said they'd protect us
From terrorism's threat
But the real enemy is
The surveillance dragnet

[Verse 3]
HHS contracts expanding every day
Health data harvested, there's no escape away
The engine of the deep state, Whitney Webb revealed
Palantir panopticon, our fate is sealed

[Outro]
(Synth descends into static)
Unless we wake up now and tear the system down
Palantir sees everything in every single town
