[Intro]
(Rising throne sounds)
He ascends to power...

[Verse 1]
The beast rises from the pit
Every piece of prophecy fits
Obama returns to the seat
Fulfillment is now complete

[Chorus]
Ascendancy of the beast tonight
Darkness overtaking light
The little horn has his hour
Rising up to deadly power
Ascendancy

[Verse 2]
He who was and was not still
Returns to execute his will
The world will worship at his feet
The dragon gives him his seat

[Bridge]
Revelation's warning clear
The beast's ascendancy is here
Ten kings give him their power
For the tribulation's hour

[Chorus]
Ascendancy of the beast tonight
Darkness overtaking light
The little horn has his hour
Rising up to deadly power
Ascendancy

[Outro]
(Throne sounds intensifying)
Do not worship the beast...
