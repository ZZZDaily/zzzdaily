[Intro]
(Media sounds, shaking jar imagery)
Who is shaking the jar? That's the question asked
Manufacturing the far-right, looking at the past

[Verse 1]
Divide and conquer, oldest trick in the book
Manufacturing outrage, take a closer look
Both sides manipulated by the same machine
Manufacturing the far-right, what does it mean?
Intelligence operations funding extremism's rise
Manufacturing the far-right, open your eyes

[Chorus]
Manufacturing the far-right, who's shaking the jar?
Both sides fighting while they watch from afar
Manufacturing the far-right, divide and rule
Making us all play the fool

[Verse 2]
Provocateurs planted, movements co-opted fast
Manufacturing the far-right, patterns from the past
COINTELPRO lessons applied to today
Manufacturing the far-right, leading astray
The real elite escape while we fight each other
Manufacturing the far-right, sister against brother

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
When the extremes get louder
Someone's turning up the sound
Manufacturing division
Until we're underground

[Verse 3]
Whitney Webb investigated who's behind the scenes
Manufacturing the far-right, what it really means
Don't fall for the division, see the bigger game
Manufacturing the far-right, they're all the same

[Outro]
(Media sounds fade)
Unity in truth against their plans
Manufacturing the far-right falls when we join hands
