[Intro]
(Scanning sounds, electronic beeps)
A new ID for America...

[Verse 1]
Real ID isn't just for driving cars
It's the framework for your digital scars
Every purchase, every move you make
Tracked and logged for freedom's sake

[Chorus]
Digital ID coming to your door
Track your life like never before
Without the number you can't buy or sell
Welcome to the technological hell
Digital ID coming

[Verse 2]
Biometric scans of face and hands
Implementation across all lands
The beast system needs to know
Everywhere you come and go

[Bridge]
It sounds convenient, that's the bait
By the time you know, it's too late
Total surveillance, total control
The price they're asking is your soul

[Chorus]
Digital ID coming to your door
Track your life like never before
Without the number you can't buy or sell
Welcome to the technological hell
Digital ID coming

[Outro]
(Electronic sounds fading)
Resist the system...
