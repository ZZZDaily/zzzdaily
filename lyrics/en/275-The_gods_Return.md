[Intro]
(Ancient Greek/Egyptian themed music)
The gods of Olympus are coming home...

[Verse 1]
They ruled in Egypt plain to see
Pyramids built with dark technology
Zeus and Hera sitting on their thrones
All fallen angels in temporal zones

[Chorus]
The gods return to rule again
Not myths or legends but fallen kin
What ancient Egypt saw will reappear
The gods return, the end is near

[Verse 2]
They'll call councils, they'll decide
Who lives or dies, who's on their side
Taking tribute just like before
Demanding worship, demanding more

[Bridge]
America will be their home
Just like ancient Egypt, ancient Rome
In full view they'll take their place
Fallen angels running the human race

[Chorus]
The gods return to rule again
Not myths or legends but fallen kin
What ancient Egypt saw will reappear
The gods return, the end is near

[Outro]
(Ancient music fading)
Do not worship them... only God...
