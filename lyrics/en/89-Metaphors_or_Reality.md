SONG 11: "Metaphors or Reality"
(Theme: A challenging question about biblical interpretation and whether scripture describes literal truth or symbolic imagery.)


[Intro]

[Verse 1]
The firmament above, is it glass or is it sky?
Ancient words paint pictures, but do they testify
To literal construction or a poet's sacred view?
When Scripture speaks of waters, what are we supposed to do?

[Chorus]
Metaphors or reality, which truth will set you free?
The dome above, the earth below—what are we meant to see?
Search the Word with honest eyes, let the Spirit be your guide,
Don't just swallow what they say, let conviction live inside.

[Verse 2]
Four hundred thousand feet, they say that's where the barrier sits,
The Bible speaks of heaven's height that no man's measured yet,
Gas and glass and mystery, the documents don't lie,
But are we reading poetry or blueprints for the sky?

[Chorus]
Metaphors or reality, which truth will set you free?
The dome above, the earth below—what are we meant to see?
Search the Word with honest eyes, let the Spirit be your guide,
Don't just swallow what they say, let conviction live inside.

[Verse 3]
They tell you it's symbolic, just ancient men's beliefs,
But maybe literal language holds the keys to your relief,
Or maybe both are dancing in a truth you can't define,
The question isn't simple when you're reading the divine.

[Verse 4]
Re-entry means coming down, not piercing through the black,
The shuttle flies two hundred thousand, then it's turning back,
Heaven for its height, earth for depth unknown,
The measurements elude them at the edge of the forbidden zone.

[Chorus]
Metaphors or reality, which truth will set you free?
The dome above, the earth below—what are we meant to see?
Search the Word with honest eyes, let the Spirit be your guide,
Don't just swallow what they say, let conviction live inside.

[Bridge]
Don't let them tell you how to read the Book,
Don't let them shame you for the path you took,
Dig deep, pray hard, let the questions rise—
The truth of God can handle your inquiring eyes.

[Chorus]
Metaphors or reality, which truth will set you free?
The dome above, the earth below—what are we meant to see?
Search the Word with honest eyes, let the Spirit be your guide,
Don't just swallow what they say, let conviction live inside.

[Outro]
Let conviction live inside... which truth will set you free?
Metaphors or reality... what are we meant to see?
