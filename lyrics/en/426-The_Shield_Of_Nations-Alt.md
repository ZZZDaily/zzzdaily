[Intro]
(Battle sounds, then divine protection)
Jesus Christ is the shield...

[Verse 1]
In the chaos of the end
Only one can be your friend
Jesus Christ the shield of all
Those who on His name do call

[Chorus]
The shield of nations, Jesus Christ
For Him many paid the price
Only He can save your soul
Only He can make you whole
The shield of nations

[Verse 2]
Every nation falls apart
But He guards the faithful heart
When the world is crumbling down
He's the shelter to be found

[Bridge]
A thousand fall at your left hand
Ten thousand cannot stand
But with God upon your side
In His shadow you abide

[Chorus]
The shield of nations, Jesus Christ
For Him many paid the price
Only He can save your soul
Only He can make you whole
The shield of nations

[Outro]
(Protection sounds)
He is our shield...
