[Intro]
(Police radio, algorithmic sounds)
Pre-crime algorithms deployed on the street
Predictive policing, minority report complete

[Verse 1]
Palantir software in police departments now
Predicting who'll commit crimes, tell me how
Data mining neighborhoods, profiling by code
Predictive policing, down this road
Innocent until proven guilty, they used to say
But algorithms decide your fate today

[Chorus]
Predictive policing, pre-crime fantasy
Turning neighborhoods into a penitentiary
Predictive policing, bias in the code
Targeting the vulnerable, lightening the load

[Verse 2]
Chicago, LA, New Orleans, the list grows long
Predictive policing, something very wrong
The same communities over-policed for years
Now algorithms justify the fears
Feedback loops of discrimination amplified
Predictive policing, nowhere to hide

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
When machines decide
Who the criminals are
The algorithm becomes
The judge and the czar

[Verse 3]
Whitney Webb exposed how Palantir spread
Predictive policing, filling us with dread
Resist the algorithmic justice they deploy
Predictive policing, seeking to destroy

[Outro]
(Radio static fades)
Human judgment, not machine control
Predictive policing threatens every soul
