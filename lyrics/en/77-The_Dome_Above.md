SONG 4: "The Dome Above"
(Theme: A contemplative piece about the firmament and the biblical description of creation's physical structure separating heaven from earth.)


[Intro]

[Verse 1]
They say we're spinning through the void of space,
But Genesis speaks of a different place,
A firmament stretched across the sky,
Dividing waters, earth from heaven high.

[Chorus]
Look up at the dome above, the structure God designed,
The firmament that separates, the truth you'll find,
Waters held above our heads, just like the Word declares,
Open up your eyes and see, the evidence is there.

[Verse 2]
Four thousand miles of Bolivian salt so flat,
One meter variance, now explain me that,
How many flat expanses fit upon a ball?
Kansas flatter than a pancake after all.

[Chorus]
Look up at the dome above, the structure God designed,
The firmament that separates, the truth you'll find,
Waters held above our heads, just like the Word declares,
Open up your eyes and see, the evidence is there.

[Verse 3]
Antarctica's edge with that blue vapor ring,
The ice wall boundary encircling everything,
They call it curvature, atmospheric haze,
But it's the border of this earthly maze.

[Verse 4]
Day two of creation, God stretched it wide,
A solid expanse where the stars reside,
Not infinite cosmos, but a crafted dome,
The heavens declare His handiwork shown.

[Chorus]
Look up at the dome above, the structure God designed,
The firmament that separates, the truth you'll find,
Waters held above our heads, just like the Word declares,
Open up your eyes and see, the evidence is there.

[Bridge]
They've hidden the blueprint, changed the story told,
Replaced the firmament with lies centuries old,
But the flat earth stretches, immovable and sure,
With boundaries and foundations that forever endure.

[Chorus]
Look up at the dome above, the structure God designed,
The firmament that separates, the truth you'll find,
Waters held above our heads, just like the Word declares,
Open up your eyes and see, the evidence is there.

[Outro]
The dome above... the truth you'll find,
Open up your eyes... the evidence is there.
