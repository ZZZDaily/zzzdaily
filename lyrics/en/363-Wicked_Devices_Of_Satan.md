[Intro]
(Sinister plotting sounds)
Many wicked devices...

[Verse 1]
Satan's toolbox full of tricks
Every scheme and politic
Vaccines just one instrument
In his orchestra of torment

[Chorus]
The wicked devices of Satan unfold
Stories more terrible than ever told
Every weapon formed against the saints
Falls short of our holy restraints
Wicked devices

[Verse 2]
Technology used for control
Supernatural theft of souls
Every corner has a trap
But God provides an escape map

[Bridge]
The devil plays a long, long game
But Jesus has already won the same
Greater is He that is in you
Than he that's in the world you knew

[Chorus]
The wicked devices of Satan unfold
Stories more terrible than ever told
Every weapon formed against the saints
Falls short of our holy restraints
Wicked devices

[Outro]
(Sinister sounds failing)
Greater is He...
