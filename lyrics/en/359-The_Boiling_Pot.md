[Intro]
(Bubbling, boiling sounds)
Jeremiah's pot facing north...

[Verse 1]
I saw a boiling pot tipped down
Facing north from every town
Contents spilling on the land
Judgment coming, none can stand

[Chorus]
The boiling pot is tilting now
Before the Lord all must bow
From the north destruction pours
Flooding through America's doors
The boiling pot

[Verse 2]
Russia, China, enemies all
Tipped to make America fall
Every wicked deed accounted
Judgment cannot be surmounted

[Bridge]
Just as Jeremiah saw
Babylon fulfills the law
What was prophesied of old
Now upon this nation told

[Chorus]
The boiling pot is tilting now
Before the Lord all must bow
From the north destruction pours
Flooding through America's doors
The boiling pot

[Outro]
(Boiling sounds fading)
The pot tips over...
