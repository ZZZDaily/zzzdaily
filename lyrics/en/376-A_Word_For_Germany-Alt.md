[Intro]
(German atmosphere, then thunder)
Germany, hear the word of the Lord...

[Verse 1]
Germany, you will face your past
Nazi judgments come at last
Russia comes to take your land
Fall beneath the northern hand

[Chorus]
A word for Germany today
God has something more to say
Your sins are not forgotten still
Judgment comes to fulfill
A word for Germany

[Verse 2]
You will be absorbed again
Under Russia's vast domain
Europe changes as God said
Old alliances are dead

[Bridge]
Russia takes what she desires
European order expires
Germany beneath her boot
Bear devours at the root

[Chorus]
A word for Germany today
God has something more to say
Your sins are not forgotten still
Judgment comes to fulfill
A word for Germany

[Outro]
(Thunder fading)
Hear and repent...
