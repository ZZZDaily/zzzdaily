[Intro]
(Quill on parchment)
Write the vision, make it plain...

[Verse 1]
God said write the decree down plain
So that those who read may gain
Understanding of what's to come
Heaven's will shall be done

[Chorus]
Write the decree, make it known
Every seed that has been sown
Shall be reaped in due time
Write the decree, every line
Write the decree

[Verse 2]
Habakkuk was told the same
Write it down in heaven's name
Though it tarry, wait for it
Every word completely fit

[Bridge]
The vision is for appointed time
Every rhythm, every rhyme
It shall speak and not lie
Write it down before you die

[Chorus]
Write the decree, make it known
Every seed that has been sown
Shall be reaped in due time
Write the decree, every line
Write the decree

[Outro]
(Writing sounds fading)
It is written...
