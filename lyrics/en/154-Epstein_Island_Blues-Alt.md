[Intro]
(Slow blues guitar, mournful)
Down in the Caribbean, evil had a home
Where the rich and powerful came to play alone

[Verse 1]
Little Saint James Island, where the secrets were kept
Flight logs full of names, while the media slept
Lolita Express flying thirty thousand feet high
VIPs and predators under the same blue sky
They said he killed himself, but the cameras went dark
Every witness disappears, leaving just a mark

[Chorus]
Epstein Island blues, won't let me rest
They buried all the evidence, swept under the best
Epstein Island blues, the list they'll never show
Cause the people on that island run the whole damn show

[Verse 2]
Ghislaine Maxwell, she was more than just a friend
Recruiting young girls for sins without an end
Her father Robert Maxwell, intelligence his trade
The apple doesn't fall far from the plans they made
Israeli military intel at the core
Sexual blackmail operations since before the war

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton
Names upon the page
But the real power brokers
Never see a cage

[Verse 3]
Intelligence operation dressed up as abuse
The victims get forgotten while the elite go loose
But the truth is rising up now, we see behind the veil
Epstein Island blues, a never-ending tale

[Outro]
(Blues guitar solo fades)
They thought they'd bury the truth, but it won't stay down
Epstein Island blues echoing through every town
