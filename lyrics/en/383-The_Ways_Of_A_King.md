[Intro]
(Throne room sounds)
Samuel warned you...

[Verse 1]
Samuel told them long ago
What a king would bring for woe
Take your sons and daughters too
Everything belongs to you

[Chorus]
The ways of a king upon the land
Taking all with iron hand
You wanted rulers just like others
Now they take your sons and brothers
The ways of a king

[Verse 2]
America wanted kings to reign
Politicians bring you pain
Taking more and giving less
Creating nothing but distress

[Bridge]
You rejected God as King
Now look at what your leaders bring
Tyranny in democracy's dress
Nothing but a wicked mess

[Chorus]
The ways of a king upon the land
Taking all with iron hand
You wanted rulers just like others
Now they take your sons and brothers
The ways of a king

[Outro]
(Throne room sounds fading)
Return to the Lord...
