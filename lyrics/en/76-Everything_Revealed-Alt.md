SONG 3: "Everything Revealed"
(Theme: A prophetic meditation on Jesus's promise that all hidden things will eventually come to light, especially in the last days.)

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
They sealed the scrolls, locked up the truth,
Hidden in darkness since the days of youth,
But Daniel heard the angel say,
"Knowledge shall increase in the final day."

[Verse 2]
Corners of the earth, foundations laid,
Firmament above where stars parade,
They call it metaphor, they call it myth,
But the Word stands firm, truth can't be dismissed.

[Chorus]
Everything hidden shall be revealed,
Every secret opened, every mystery unsealed,
In the last days the light breaks through,
What was covered in darkness comes into view.

[Verse 3]
Satan loosed to deceive the nations wide,
Four corners, breadth of earth, nowhere to hide,
Fire comes down, the camp surrounded,
On the Word of God our faith is founded.

[Verse 4]
From the rising sun to where it sets,
His glory proclaimed, no more regrets,
The sealed book opened, vision clear,
The time is short, the end is near.

[Chorus]
Everything hidden shall be revealed,
Every secret opened, every mystery unsealed,
In the last days the light breaks through,
What was covered in darkness comes into view.

[Bridge]
No more calling Scripture just a metaphor,
His resurrection opened up the door,
The crucifixion real, the blood was shed,
He conquered death, rose from the dead!

[Chorus]
Everything hidden shall be revealed,
Every secret opened, every mystery unsealed,
In the last days the light breaks through,
What was covered in darkness comes into view.

[Outro]
The mystery unsealed... everything revealed,
Stand on the Word... let the truth be heard.
