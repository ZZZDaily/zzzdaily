[Intro]
(Approaching army sounds)
They're already here...

[Verse 1]
The enemy is at the gates
Surrounding all the United States
Not coming soon, they're already near
The invasion you should fear

[Chorus]
Enemy at the gates tonight
Preparing for the final fight
While America sleeps and plays
The armies count the days
Enemy at the gates

[Verse 2]
Sleeper cells in every city
Foreign soldiers without pity
Waiting for the signal call
To make America fall

[Bridge]
The gates are not protected well
America under a spell
Ignoring every warning sign
Until the armies cross the line

[Chorus]
Enemy at the gates tonight
Preparing for the final fight
While America sleeps and plays
The armies count the days
Enemy at the gates

[Outro]
(Army sounds intensifying then cut)
Wake up America...
