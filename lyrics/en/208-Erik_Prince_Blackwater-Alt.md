[Intro]
(Helicopter sounds, combat ambience)
Erik Prince built Blackwater, mercenary might
Now teaming with Israeli spies in plain sight

[Verse 1]
Private military contracting, war for profit's sake
Blackwater's bloody history, no mistake
Nisour Square massacre, Iraqi civilians dead
Erik Prince Blackwater, contractor widespread
Renamed and rebranded, Academi now
Same business model, different vow

[Chorus]
Erik Prince Blackwater, privatizing war
Mercenary armies, what are they for?
Erik Prince Blackwater, blood money flows
Intelligence operations, everybody knows

[Verse 2]
Teamed up with Israeli spy, front company made
Selling defense technology, exploiting the trade
Loopholes for Israeli tech to reach American military
Erik Prince Blackwater, the picture is clear
Trump administration ties running deep
Erik Prince Blackwater, promises to keep

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
When private armies
Serve the highest bid
Who controls the violence
And what it did?

[Verse 3]
Whitney Webb exposed the Prince and the Spy
Erik Prince Blackwater, wings spread wide
Accountability absent for contractors of war
Erik Prince Blackwater, what's it all for?

[Outro]
(Combat sounds fade)
Private war makes profits, but the public pays
Erik Prince Blackwater, end these ways
