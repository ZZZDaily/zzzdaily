[Intro]
(Tearing, ripping sounds in atmosphere)
Something is coming through...

[Verse 1]
I saw a portal open wide
A hole in the sky you cannot hide
Something massive breaking through
Ancient beings returning to view

[Chorus]
The hole in the sky is opening now
Before these beings all will bow
Not the rapture, something more
Fallen ones coming through heaven's door
The hole in the sky

[Verse 2]
Bright burning circles spinning round
Fire in the heavens, coming down
Multiple portals everywhere
Ripping open, be aware

[Bridge]
We'll all see their grand entrance clear
Not just visions, they'll appear
In many different forms they come
The invasion has begun

[Chorus]
The hole in the sky is opening now
Before these beings all will bow
Not the rapture, something more
Fallen ones coming through heaven's door
The hole in the sky

[Outro]
(Atmospheric tearing sounds fading)
Look up... and pray...
