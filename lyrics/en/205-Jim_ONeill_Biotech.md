[Intro]
(Laboratory sounds, warning alarms)
Jim O'Neill at HHS, Thiel's man inside
Biotech deregulation, nowhere to hide

[Verse 1]
Peter Thiel associate for the longest time
Pushing for reforms that cross the line
Skip the efficacy trials, just show it's safe
Get products to market at a faster pace
The MAHA movement wanted something clean
But O'Neill's biotech threatens that dream

[Chorus]
Jim O'Neill biotech, deregulation's face
Dangerous products entering the marketplace
Jim O'Neill biotech, Thiel's vision deployed
Consumer protection being destroyed

[Verse 2]
Innovation and efficiency, that's what they say
While letting untested products have their way
Biosurveillance through Palantir grows
Jim O'Neill biotech, how deep it goes
HHS contracts expanding Thiel's domain
Jim O'Neill biotech, corporate gain

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
When the foxes guard
The henhouse door
What protections remain
Anymore?

[Verse 3]
Whitney Webb warned about this pick
Jim O'Neill biotech, the plot is thick
Health and Human Services captured now
Jim O'Neill biotech showing us how

[Outro]
(Alarms fade to silence)
Question the appointees and their masters' goals
Jim O'Neill biotech takes its toll
