[Intro]
They call it jokes but the jewelry tells the truth
Pedophilia symbols worn by men uncouth

[Verse 1]
Royal Order of Jesters, invitation only
Shriners at the top feeling so lonely
Custom pins showing children in their art
Bestiality symbols, darkness in their heart

[Chorus]
Freemason Jesters wearing evil on their chest
Judges, cops, and politicians dressed their best
How long can you claim it's just a joke?
When the same crimes keep happening, the pattern spoke

[Verse 2]
Human trafficking busts keep naming them
But the brotherhood protects each gem
Police investigating their own kind
Justice is blind when masons are assigned

[Bridge]
It's not all of them, that's always the cry
But the good ones cover for the bad, that's the lie
If you saw this symbol anywhere else
You'd call it what it is, evil itself

[Chorus]
Freemason Jesters wearing evil on their chest
Judges, cops, and politicians dressed their best
How long can you claim it's just a joke?
When the same crimes keep happening, the pattern spoke

[Outro]
Secret societies controlling everything
From the courts to the churches, they pull the string
Time to shine the light on darkness hidden
Expose the crimes that have been forbidden
