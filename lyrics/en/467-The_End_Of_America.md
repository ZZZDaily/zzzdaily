[Intro]
(Flatline, then silence)
It is finished...

[Verse 1]
Everything I've told you here
Will happen, never fear
America as you have known
Will reap what she has sown

[Chorus]
The end of America has come
Every prophecy is done
What was great is brought so low
This is how the story goes
The end of America

[Verse 2]
Russia takes, China claims
Nothing left but ashen flames
The empire built on pride
Has nowhere left to hide

[Bridge]
But for those who trust the Lord
Holding to His faithful Word
Though the nation falls apart
Christ protects the faithful heart

[Chorus]
The end of America has come
Every prophecy is done
What was great is brought so low
This is how the story goes
The end of America

[Outro]
(Silence, then hope)
But God remains...
