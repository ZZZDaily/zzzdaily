[Intro]
(Nature sounds, then ominous)
The fig tree and its seeds...

[Verse 1]
God showed me the fig and seeds
Representing humanity's deeds
Modified at the core now
Altered seed, corrupted plough

[Chorus]
The fig and the seeds revealed
What the vaccines have concealed
DNA no longer pure
Human genome not secure
The fig and the seeds

[Verse 2]
Seeds of change inside you grow
Things that only Satan knows
What you welcomed in your arm
Brings more than physical harm

[Bridge]
The fig tree withered at Christ's word
Judgment that the whole world heard
So shall be the altered seed
Withering is all that's freed

[Chorus]
The fig and the seeds revealed
What the vaccines have concealed
DNA no longer pure
Human genome not secure
The fig and the seeds

[Outro]
(Nature sounds distorting)
Guard your seed...
