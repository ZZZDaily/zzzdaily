SONG 1: "Not Ashamed"
(Theme: A defiant anthem about standing firm in controversial beliefs despite widespread opposition and ridicule from mainstream voices.)

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
They mock and laugh when I speak the truth,
Call me crazy, say I've lost my youth,
But I stand on solid ground today,
Won't let their voices lead me astray.

[Chorus]
I'm not ashamed of what I believe,
Won't bow down, won't be deceived,
They can ridicule, they can scorn my name,
But I'm standing tall, I'm not ashamed.

[Verse 2]
The mainstream tells me what to think,
Says I'm foolish standing on the brink,
But freedom comes from knowing what's real,
No compromise on what I feel.

[Chorus]
I'm not ashamed of what I believe,
Won't bow down, won't be deceived,
They can ridicule, they can scorn my name,
But I'm standing tall, I'm not ashamed.

[Verse 3]
They want conformity, want me to fall in line,
But I've got revelation, truth divine,
The power's in the Word that sets me free,
Not in the lies they're selling me.

[Verse 4]
So let them talk, let them say I'm wrong,
I'll keep on singing my defiant song,
With every breath I'll testify,
To the truth that they can't deny.

[Bridge]
Yesterday, today, and tomorrow still,
I'm anchored firm by iron will,
They designed their trap but I won't play,
I'm walking in the light of day.

[Chorus]
I'm not ashamed of what I believe,
Won't bow down, won't be deceived,
They can ridicule, they can scorn my name,
But I'm standing tall, I'm not ashamed.

[Outro]
I'm not ashamed... standing in the flame,
Forever bold... I'm not ashamed.
