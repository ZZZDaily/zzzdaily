[Intro]
(Distant gunfire, shouting)
Blood will run in the streets...

[Verse 1]
America divided red and blue
Hatred growing in everything you do
Brother against brother, state against state
The cockfight comes, it won't be late

[Chorus]
Civil war is coming to American soil
Division, hatred, endless turmoil
Like Somalia's war will be your own
Reaping everything that you have sown
Civil war is coming

[Verse 2]
Fighting spills to Canada above
Mexico below, no more love
Americans jumping border fences south
Hiding with those you shut out

[Bridge]
The Mexicans will show them love
Protection from the Lord above
White people hiding among brown
When their own cities burn down

[Chorus]
Civil war is coming to American soil
Division, hatred, endless turmoil
Like Somalia's war will be your own
Reaping everything that you have sown
Civil war is coming

[Outro]
(Fading sounds of conflict)
Repent before it's too late...
