[Intro]
Nineteen seventeen, Congress convened
For a machine that powered like nothing they'd seen

[Verse 1]
Garabed built a generator free
Congress saw it working perfectly
Then they classified it, national security
The inventor vanished into obscurity

[Chorus]
Garabed free energy, proven and real
Congress saw it, sealed the deal
A hundred years later still burning oil
Keeping humanity in perpetual toil

[Verse 2]
Hendershot's motor, same result
Military testing deemed it occult
Patents bought up, inventors die
The petrodollar can't let them fly

[Bridge]
If energy was free what would happen then?
No more power over women and men
Can't have that, control would slip
So they silence every inventor's lip

[Chorus]
Garabed free energy, proven and real
Congress saw it, sealed the deal
A hundred years later still burning oil
Keeping humanity in perpetual toil

[Outro]
The ether powers everything around
But they buried that knowledge in the ground
One day we'll be free from their chains
When humanity finally breaks their reins
