[Intro]
(Church organ, ominous)
They're building digital chains for your money and soul
Central Bank Digital Currency, total control

[Verse 1]
Bank for International Settlements, Basle Switzerland base
Directing all the central banks, setting the pace
Ninety-five percent of the world's banks in their grip
When they flip the switch, your freedom takes a dip
Linked to digital ID, biometrics required
Your face, your prints, your iris, all hardwired

[Chorus]
CBDC chains gonna lock you down
Every transaction monitored in every town
CBDC chains, programmable money's here
Obey or they freeze your accounts, that's the fear

[Verse 2]
Canadian truckers showed us what they'd do
Froze their bank accounts when protests grew
That was just a preview of the coming age
When your social credit score determines your wage
Buy the wrong products, say the wrong things
CBDC chains clip your financial wings

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Cash is freedom, that's what they fear
So they're eliminating it, year by year
When every penny is tracked and traced
Your economic liberty is erased

[Verse 3]
Whitney Webb exposed their UN documents clear
The integration of CBDC and ID is here
But we still have time to build another way
CBDC chains don't have to rule the day

[Outro]
(Organ swells then cuts to silence)
The choice is ours, surveillance or free
CBDC chains or human dignity
