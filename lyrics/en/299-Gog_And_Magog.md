[Intro]
(War drums, ancient horns)
Ezekiel's prophecy awakens...

[Verse 1]
From the north comes Gog at last
Magog's armies vast and vast
Meshech and Tubal join the fight
Against Israel in the night

[Chorus]
Gog and Magog ride to war
Ancient enemies at the door
But God will fight for Israel's name
Supernatural holy flame
Gog and Magog fall

[Verse 2]
Persia, Ethiopia, Libya too
All the nations Satan drew
Coming against the Holy Land
But falling by God's mighty hand

[Bridge]
Fire and brimstone from above
God defending those He loves
Bodies cover all the ground
Seven months to bury them down

[Chorus]
Gog and Magog ride to war
Ancient enemies at the door
But God will fight for Israel's name
Supernatural holy flame
Gog and Magog fall

[Outro]
(War drums fading, divine light sounds)
The Lord defends Israel...
