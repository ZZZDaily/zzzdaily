[Intro]
(Video game sounds)
Breaking down the system...

[Verse 1]
I saw a video game on screen
Breaking bricks, you know what I mean
Each brick was a system's part
Shattering from the start

[Chorus]
The brick breaker game is real
One by one the systems peel
Government, money, power falls
Brick by brick collapse the walls
Brick breaker

[Verse 2]
Healthcare, education too
Law enforcement breaking through
Every institution known
Crumbling like they're alone

[Bridge]
The ball bounces and destroys
All your comforts, all your toys
Nothing stable, nothing stays
Welcome to the end of days

[Chorus]
The brick breaker game is real
One by one the systems peel
Government, money, power falls
Brick by brick collapse the walls
Brick breaker

[Outro]
(Game over sounds)
System failure...
