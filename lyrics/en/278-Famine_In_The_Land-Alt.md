[Intro]
(Empty, hollow sounds)
There will be no grain in America...

[Verse 1]
Food production at an all-time low
Crisis levels where the bread won't grow
Hunger spreading household to household wide
Only God's remnant will be supplied

[Chorus]
Famine in the land, empty shelves tonight
Starvation coming without grain in sight
The abundance taken away
America's judgment day
Famine in the land

[Verse 2]
Dairies burning, plants on fire
Food supply chain funeral pyre
Drought in California, floods elsewhere
Breadbasket empty, none to spare

[Bridge]
If God did not preserve a remnant here
All flesh would perish, that much is clear
But for the sake of those He knows
A little food still grows

[Chorus]
Famine in the land, empty shelves tonight
Starvation coming without grain in sight
The abundance taken away
America's judgment day
Famine in the land

[Outro]
(Hollow wind sounds)
Store up while you can...
