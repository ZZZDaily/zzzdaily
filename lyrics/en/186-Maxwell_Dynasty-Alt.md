[Intro]
(Minor key strings, mysterious)
Robert Maxwell built an empire on intelligence and lies
His daughter Ghislaine carried on before our eyes

[Verse 1]
Media mogul, spy, and con man all in one
Robert Maxwell's work was never done
Israeli military intelligence pulled the strings
Mossad operations behind the scenes of things
When he fell from his yacht, the mystery remains
But his networks kept on running through his daughter's veins

[Chorus]
Maxwell dynasty, passing down the trade
Intelligence and blackmail, that's how fortunes made
Maxwell dynasty, from father to child
Running honey traps while the elite smiled

[Verse 2]
Ghislaine took the reins with Jeffrey by her side
Recruiting, grooming, trafficking, no place to hide
The pilots, the staff, they all knew the game
Maxwell dynasty operational just the same
Convicted but protecting bigger names on the list
Maxwell dynasty, see who they missed

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
When the father dies
The children carry on
Intelligence dynasties
Continue from the dawn

[Verse 3]
Whitney Webb traced it all from beginning to end
Maxwell dynasty, where does the blackmail extend?
The names we know are small compared to what's concealed
Maxwell dynasty, not fully revealed

[Outro]
(Strings fade mysteriously)
The dynasty continues, hidden from our view
Maxwell dynasty, what else is true?
