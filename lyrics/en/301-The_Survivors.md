[Intro]
(Wind, distant echoes)
Those who endure to the end...

[Verse 1]
In the wasteland of what used to be
Small groups moving carefully
Character tested every single day
The strong in faith will find a way

[Chorus]
The survivors walk by faith alone
God's protection, heaven's throne
Through the fire, through the flood
Covered by the Savior's blood
The survivors

[Verse 2]
Poor character will cost your life
In this world of endless strife
Humble hearts and quiet souls
These are they who reach their goals

[Bridge]
No more bullying gets its way
Someone cracks your skull one day
Lawlessness strips pretense bare
Only the righteous survive out there

[Chorus]
The survivors walk by faith alone
God's protection, heaven's throne
Through the fire, through the flood
Covered by the Savior's blood
The survivors

[Outro]
(Wind sounds fading)
Endure to the end...
