[Intro]
(Dawn sounds, community building)
We've learned what they're doing, now what's the plan?
Wake up and build, do what you can

[Verse 1]
Whitney Webb and all the journalists exposing the scheme
Wake up and build, live the dream
Knowledge without action keeps us in despair
Wake up and build, show you care
Local food, local money, local community
Wake up and build with unity

[Chorus]
Wake up and build, the antidote to doom
In every challenge, there is room
Wake up and build, parallel systems rise
Outside their control, hear the cries

[Verse 2]
It sucks to learn the mob runs the world, Whitney said
Wake up and build, or stay in bed
But she chose to build for her three kids' sake
Wake up and build, for heaven's sake
We're not here to just survive their plan
Wake up and build, every woman and man

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
The control grid they're building
Requires our consent
When we build alternatives
Their power is spent

[Verse 3]
Support independent media speaking truth
Wake up and build, for our youth
The future isn't written yet in stone
Wake up and build, you're not alone

[Outro]
(Dawn builds to full light, community celebration)
We've got each other and the truth we've found
Wake up and build, turn it around
This isn't the end, it's the beginning bright
Wake up and build, step into the light!

(Joyful chorus)
Wake up! Wake up! And build!
