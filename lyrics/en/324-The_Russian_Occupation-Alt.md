[Intro]
(Russian speech, orders shouted)
Hardship under occupation...

[Verse 1]
I lived in the occupation time
Where every move is tracked as crime
Russian soldiers everywhere
American pride stripped bare

[Chorus]
The Russian occupation day
When everything is taken away
They mirror what you did abroad
Welcome to your reward
The Russian occupation

[Verse 2]
Camps set up for citizens
Defiance brings your discipline
They touch your women in the lines
Asking where your movies' signs

[Bridge]
Every torture you exported
Back on you is now reported
What your soldiers did in secret
Now you feel it, now you meet it

[Chorus]
The Russian occupation day
When everything is taken away
They mirror what you did abroad
Welcome to your reward
The Russian occupation

[Outro]
(Russian orders fading)
This is coming...
