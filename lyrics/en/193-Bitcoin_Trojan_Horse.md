[Intro]
(Electronic beats, warning bells)
They said Bitcoin was freedom, breaking every chain
But the PayPal Mafia made it serve their reign

[Verse 1]
Mark Goodwin and Whitney Webb tracked the trail
Dollar hegemony using crypto's sail
Stablecoins dollar-backed spreading worldwide
Using Bitcoin infrastructure to strengthen the ride
Developing nations getting dollarized
Through crypto they're getting colonized

[Chorus]
Bitcoin Trojan horse, not what it seems
Freedom tech captured by oligarch schemes
Bitcoin Trojan horse, PayPal mafia's game
Different tools of control, but the goal's the same

[Verse 2]
Rootstock and sidechains, carbon credits flow
Satellogic surveillance, watching what you owe
They built the rails for total surveillance finance
Bitcoin Trojan horse, not a freedom dance
El Salvador and beyond, the pattern is clear
Financial surveillance spreading year by year

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
The tech was revolutionary
Breaking banks was the dream
But captured infrastructure
Isn't what it seemed

[Verse 3]
There's still hope if used right, outside their control
Bitcoin Trojan horse doesn't have to take your soul
But know who's building the bridges and why
Bitcoin Trojan horse, question everything they try

[Outro]
(Beats fade to acoustic)
Crypto can be freedom or another chain
Bitcoin Trojan horse, who stands to gain?
