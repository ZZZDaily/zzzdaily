[Intro]
(Deep ominous bass tones)
As it was in the days of Noah...

[Verse 1]
There were giants in the earth in those days
Sons of God came down in ancient ways
They took the daughters of men as their wives
And bred abominations, half-demon lives

[Chorus]
The Nephilim return, they're breaking through the ground
Ice giants rising up without a sound
What was buried shall be found
The ancient ones return
The Nephilim return

[Verse 2]
Thirteen feet tall, King Og of Bashan
Goliath and his brothers, six-fingered clan
God judged them once with water and with fire
But Satan preserved them for his dark desire

[Bridge]
They will punch through frozen graves
When the temperature shifts and changes
Every memory of vengeance saved
Walking death on ancient ranges

[Chorus]
The Nephilim return, they're breaking through the ground
Ice giants rising up without a sound
What was buried shall be found
The ancient ones return
The Nephilim return

[Outro]
(Thunderous drums fading)
Prepare the way... they're coming back...
