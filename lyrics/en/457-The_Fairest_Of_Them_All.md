[Intro]
(Mirror sounds)
Mirror, mirror...

[Verse 1]
Russia asks the looking glass
Who will rise and who will pass?
America's reflection fades
As Russia's star upgrades

[Chorus]
The fairest of them all will rise
Russia underneath the skies
Taking America's place
In the global power race
The fairest of them all

[Verse 2]
Renaissance for Mother Russia
Capitalism, national lustre
Popular democracy, flags wave high
America wondering why

[Bridge]
The tables turn, the mirror shows
Who has friends and who has foes
What was certain now is not
Russia claims America's spot

[Chorus]
The fairest of them all will rise
Russia underneath the skies
Taking America's place
In the global power race
The fairest of them all

[Outro]
(Mirror sounds fading)
The mirror doesn't lie...
