[Intro]
(Collapsing sounds)
The mighty has fallen...

[Verse 1]
Babylon the great has fallen
God's judgment has been callin'
The eagle crashes from the sky
Even mighty empires die

[Chorus]
The fall of America has come
Everything we've ever done
Judged and weighed and found so light
Falling in the final night
The fall of America

[Verse 2]
From sea to shining sea
Nothing of what used to be
Cities burned and people fled
The American dream is dead

[Bridge]
Russia stands on the ashes here
China takes what she holds dear
The enemies divide the spoils
End of America's turmoils

[Chorus]
The fall of America has come
Everything we've ever done
Judged and weighed and found so light
Falling in the final night
The fall of America

[Outro]
(Collapsing sounds completing)
She has fallen...
