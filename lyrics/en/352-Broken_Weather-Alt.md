[Intro]
(Weather chaos sounds)
The weather is broken...

[Verse 1]
Space travel they achieve
While the atmosphere won't leave
Broken weather everywhere
Climate chaos beyond repair

[Chorus]
Broken weather, broken skies
Everything before your eyes
Nature groaning for release
Creation knows no peace
Broken weather

[Verse 2]
Unprecedented storms arise
Fire in unexpected skies
Cold where it was never cold
Heat waves manifold

[Bridge]
They poke holes through God's design
Push the boundaries of the line
Nature responds with fury great
As humanity seals its fate

[Chorus]
Broken weather, broken skies
Everything before your eyes
Nature groaning for release
Creation knows no peace
Broken weather

[Outro]
(Weather chaos fading)
Creation groans...
