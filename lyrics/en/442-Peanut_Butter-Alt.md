[Intro]
(Scraping jar sounds)
Open your mouth wide...

[Verse 1]
Open your mouth and I will fill
God says, trust me, you will feel
Supernatural provision come
Even when the world's undone

[Chorus]
Like peanut butter from the jar
Provision comes from near and far
God will feed His faithful few
Even when there's nothing to do
Open your mouth

[Verse 2]
Elijah by the brook was fed
Ravens bringing meat and bread
The widow's oil never stopped
Until the famine finally dropped

[Bridge]
In the coming days of need
God will meet you, God will feed
Those who trust in His great name
Provision comes, always the same

[Chorus]
Like peanut butter from the jar
Provision comes from near and far
God will feed His faithful few
Even when there's nothing to do
Open your mouth

[Outro]
(Jar sounds fading)
Trust His provision...
