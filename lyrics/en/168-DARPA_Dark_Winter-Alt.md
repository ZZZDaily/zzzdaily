[Intro]
(Military drums, ominous brass)
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency dreams
Building tomorrow's nightmares in their research schemes

[Verse 1]
DARPA's darkest agenda got a boost from the plague
Biosurveillance technologies no longer vague
Brain-machine interfaces for the soldier class
DNA-altering vaccines moving fast
Techno-tyranny disguised as public health
Orwellian vision building silent wealth

[Chorus]
DARPA Dark Winter, coming for your mind
Military research of the darkest kind
DARPA Dark Winter, science fiction real
When the pandemic hit, they unveiled the deal

[Verse 2]
All Roads Lead to Dark Winter, that's the title true
June 2001 simulation, then anthrax flew
Sam Nunn played the president in that deadly game
Months later real anthrax, just the same
USAMRIID connections, Fort Detrick's name
Engineering contagion, who's really to blame?

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
They practice for pandemics
Then pandemics arrive
Coincidence or planning?
Ask the dead who didn't survive

[Verse 3]
Operation Warp Speed, military in command
DARPA's fingerprints across the vaccine land
Whitney Webb warned us about this technocracy
DARPA Dark Winter threatens democracy

[Outro]
(Drums fade to silence)
The Pentagon's research becomes our fate
DARPA Dark Winter at the freedom gate
