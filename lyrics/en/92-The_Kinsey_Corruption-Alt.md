[Intro]
They funded the darkness, called it science and research
Rockefeller money, putting children in the dirt

[Verse 1]
Back in the forties there was evil in the lab
Alfred Kinsey with his data making innocence look bad
CIA was funding through their front companies
Molesting little babies calling trauma ecstasy

[Chorus]
It's the Kinsey corruption running deep in the state
Sex by age eight or else it's too late
That's what the monster said as he wrote down his lies
Government approved while the children cried

[Verse 2]
They changed the laws to protect the predator class
Victimless crime that's what they said would pass
Beryl Levy wrote that women can't be raped
Federal judges pushing evil on the slate

[Bridge]
Follow the money to the Rockefeller door
They've been running this agenda since before the Civil War
Psychology industry built on Freud's sick mind
Every institution captured, darkness by design

[Chorus]
It's the Kinsey corruption running deep in the state
Sex by age eight or else it's too late
That's what the monster said as he wrote down his lies
Government approved while the children cried

[Outro]
Wake up, wake up, see who's running the show
The same evil bloodlines from a hundred years ago
