[Intro]
(Deep ocean rumbles, massive movements)
Read Job chapter 41...

[Verse 1]
Scales of iron, breath of fire
A creature from the ocean's mire
Not a spirit, not a myth
Living beast that God made with

[Chorus]
Leviathan rises from the deep
While foolish mortals fall asleep
The sea dragon of ancient days
Will make you stand in stunned amaze
Leviathan rises

[Verse 2]
Ships will fall before his tail
Sonar systems all will fail
Proving to humanity
God's creatures aren't fantasy

[Bridge]
People say he isn't real
Just wait until you see and feel
What's been swimming all along
In the deep where he belongs

[Chorus]
Leviathan rises from the deep
While foolish mortals fall asleep
The sea dragon of ancient days
Will make you stand in stunned amaze
Leviathan rises

[Outro]
(Ocean rumbles fading)
The Bible is real...
