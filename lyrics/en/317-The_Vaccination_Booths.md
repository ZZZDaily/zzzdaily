[Intro]
(Queue sounds, official announcements)
And he causes all...

[Verse 1]
I saw the booths lined up in rows
Where everyone in America goes
QR codes and certificates
Processing your final fate

[Chorus]
The vaccination booths are here
Marking everyone with fear
Show your pass or don't come in
This is where it all begins
The vaccination booths

[Verse 2]
No dining out, no movies for you
Unless you've had the jab times two
Freedom shrinks with every dose
Control is what they want the most

[Bridge]
Fulfilled in just four months time
Just as God said in the rhyme
New York City first to fall
In lockstep, they caused all

[Chorus]
The vaccination booths are here
Marking everyone with fear
Show your pass or don't come in
This is where it all begins
The vaccination booths

[Outro]
(Queue sounds fading)
Resist while you can...
