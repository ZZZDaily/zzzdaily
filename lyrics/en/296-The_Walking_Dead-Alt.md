[Intro]
(Heartbeat monitor flatlines, then footsteps)
Men shall seek death and not find it...

[Verse 1]
I saw them rise from hospital beds
Not asleep but truly dead
Gunshot wounds still in their chest
No longer needing any rest

[Chorus]
The walking dead shall rise again
Not in Christ but twisted men
Revelation's prophecy unfolds
The dead walk as the scripture told
The walking dead

[Verse 2]
Medical staff runs away in fear
Patients dead for hours reappear
Something dark has called them back
Humanity is what they lack

[Bridge]
Satan counterfeits the resurrection
His dark twisted insurrection
While Jesus raises saints to glory
The devil writes a different story

[Chorus]
The walking dead shall rise again
Not in Christ but twisted men
Revelation's prophecy unfolds
The dead walk as the scripture told
The walking dead

[Outro]
(Flatline becoming footsteps)
Prepare your hearts...
