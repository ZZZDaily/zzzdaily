[Intro]
(Cash register sounds distorting)
America will be like Zimbabwe...

[Verse 1]
Thirty-two trillion dollars deep in debt
The world reserve currency's sun will set
Brazil and Russia, China and more
Leaving the dollar, closing the door

[Chorus]
The dollar falls, the dollar falls
Babylon's wealth crumbles within her walls
What you built on paper lies
Watch your money vaporize
The dollar falls

[Verse 2]
A system's coming where cash won't exist
Digital currency you can't resist
Control of buying, control of selling
The mark approaches, can you hear heaven telling?

[Bridge]
They'll introduce it as a solution
To the crisis of their own creation
CBDCs to track your every move
Your freedom they will soon remove

[Chorus]
The dollar falls, the dollar falls
Babylon's wealth crumbles within her walls
What you built on paper lies
Watch your money vaporize
The dollar falls

[Outro]
(Distorted electronic sounds)
Prepare... prepare...
