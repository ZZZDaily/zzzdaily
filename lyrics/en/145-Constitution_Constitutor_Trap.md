[Intro]
We the people, that's what they said
But look at the fine print, and you'll see red

[Verse 1]
Constitutor means you pay someone's debt
The founding fathers made the perfect net
Revolution funded by the same old bank
British crown still pulling rank

[Chorus]
Constitution trap, we're constitutors all
Paying for a debt from before we could crawl
Land of the free but we're owned from birth
How much is your freedom really worth?

[Verse 2]
Birth certificate traded on the stock
Social Security number, tick tick tock
Strawman corporation bearing your name
Playing in a system rigged for their game

[Bridge]
Hamilton set up the banks first thing
Same Rothschild money from the king
Different flag, same old control
They bought America body and soul

[Chorus]
Constitution trap, we're constitutors all
Paying for a debt from before we could crawl
Land of the free but we're owned from birth
How much is your freedom really worth?

[Outro]
Know the law, learn the game
The system's different when you know the name
Sovereignty is possible for those who seek
But most are too comfortable and too weak
