[Intro]
(Blues guitar meets electronic pulse)
Silicon Valley boys made their fortune young
Now they're running governments with forked tongue

[Verse 1]
Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, the original crew
Reid Hoffman, Max Levchin, and the rest who grew
From X.com and Confinity to PayPal's rise
They learned to move money before your eyes
But the real game was always about control
Digital finance infrastructure, that was the goal

[Chorus]
PayPal Mafia blues, running everything you see
From DOGE to Palantir, nothing is free
PayPal Mafia blues, libertarian disguise
But they're building the technocracy before your eyes

[Verse 2]
Thiel funds the candidates, Vance is his man
Musk took over Twitter, that was the plan
David Sacks advising on AI and crypto now
The whole administration, they're running the show
They talk about free markets, freedom of speech
But total surveillance is what they preach

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
They froze your bank accounts
In Canada that day
Now imagine when they have
Complete financial sway

[Verse 3]
The PayPal Presidency has finally arrived
Techno-oligarchs, and freedom barely survived
But Whitney Webb warned us, she laid it all bare
PayPal Mafia blues, if you only dare to care

[Outro]
(Guitar solo fades to electronic hum)
From the garage to the government, the takeover's done
PayPal Mafia blues, they think they've won
