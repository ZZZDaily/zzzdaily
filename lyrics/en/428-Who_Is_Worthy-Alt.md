[Intro]
(Throne room worship)
Who is worthy to open the scroll...

[Verse 1]
In heaven's court the question rang
No angel found, no elder sang
Who can open the seven seals?
Only One who with power deals

[Chorus]
Who is worthy? Only One
Jesus Christ, God's only Son
Lion of Judah, Lamb once slain
Only He has the right to reign
Who is worthy?

[Verse 2]
He alone has paid the cost
Found what Adam and Eve lost
Worthy is the Lamb they sing
Jesus Christ, the King of kings

[Bridge]
Every creature bows down low
To the Lamb, the only One they know
Worthy of all honor, glory, praise
Now and through eternal days

[Chorus]
Who is worthy? Only One
Jesus Christ, God's only Son
Lion of Judah, Lamb once slain
Only He has the right to reign
Who is worthy?

[Outro]
(Worship intensifying)
Worthy is the Lamb...
