[Intro]
(Whips cracking, orders shouted)
Like Pharaoh's Egypt...

[Verse 1]
Public policy and economic laws
Creating slavery without a pause
Xenophobia, national hysteria
Used to strip away America

[Chorus]
The taskmasters return again
Pharaoh's model over men
Overseers watching every move
Freedom's in a downward groove
The taskmasters return

[Verse 2]
No right to travel, no right to own
Every seed of freedom sown
Ripped away by those in power
Dark agenda every hour

[Bridge]
They turned Israel into slaves
Using laws and social waves
America will face the same
Playing Pharaoh's wicked game

[Chorus]
The taskmasters return again
Pharaoh's model over men
Overseers watching every move
Freedom's in a downward groove
The taskmasters return

[Outro]
(Whips fading)
History repeats...
