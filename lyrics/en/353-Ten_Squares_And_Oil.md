[Intro]
(Oil being poured, counting)
Decimated humanity...

[Verse 1]
I saw ten squares upon a board
Each representing lives, the Lord
Showed population decimated
Only ten percent still fated

[Chorus]
Ten squares and a cruse of oil
What's left after all the toil
Ninety percent of mankind gone
Only ten percent carry on
Ten squares

[Verse 2]
Like the widow's oil that flowed
God's provision overflowed
Those who trust Him will survive
Kept supernaturally alive

[Bridge]
The culling of humanity
Through plague and war's insanity
But God preserves His faithful few
Just as He promised to do

[Chorus]
Ten squares and a cruse of oil
What's left after all the toil
Ninety percent of mankind gone
Only ten percent carry on
Ten squares

[Outro]
(Oil pouring fading)
Be among the ten...
