[Intro]
Lester Hendershot built a motor that was free
Then they came for him, and that's the key

[Verse 1]
Garabed in 1917, Congress came to see
Free energy generator working perfectly
Government said classified, national security
The inventor disappeared into obscurity

[Chorus]
Free energy murdered, inventors silenced too
Anyone who threatens oil will pay their due
Tesla's work was stolen, Hendershot was framed
Every time the truth comes out, someone gets blamed

[Verse 2]
Car that runs on water, engines needing none
Patents get bought up, inventors on the run
Suicide they call it when the threat's too real
Big oil and bankers always get their deal

[Bridge]
A hundred years of cover-up for the petrodollar scheme
Keeping humanity enslaved to their regime
We could power everything from the ether free
But that doesn't make money for their dynasty

[Chorus]
Free energy murdered, inventors silenced too
Anyone who threatens oil will pay their due
Tesla's work was stolen, Hendershot was framed
Every time the truth comes out, someone gets blamed

[Outro]
The technology exists, it always has
But releasing it would deflate their gas
One day we'll be free from their chains of fuel
Until then we're just another fossil fuel
