[Intro]
(Futuristic vehicle sounds)
Abominable weapons of war...

[Verse 1]
I saw hovercrafts in the sky
Weapons of war passing by
Russia's technology so vast
Things that make your memory last

[Chorus]
Hovercrafts and weapons strange
Technology beyond your range
Abominable instruments of death
Taking America's last breath
Hovercrafts of war

[Verse 2]
Weapons that don't even exist
In your Pentagon's list
Future tech that shocks the mind
Leaving devastation behind

[Bridge]
While you played with money games
Russia built these devastating flames
Weapons you have never seen
More terrible than any dream

[Chorus]
Hovercrafts and weapons strange
Technology beyond your range
Abominable instruments of death
Taking America's last breath
Hovercrafts of war

[Outro]
(Futuristic weapons fading)
You're not prepared...
