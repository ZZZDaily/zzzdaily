[Intro]
(Explosions, Middle Eastern atmosphere)
Isaiah 17 shall be fulfilled...

[Verse 1]
Damascus, ancient city old
Isaiah's prophecy unfolds
America will strike this place
The burden finally takes place

[Chorus]
Damascus falls, a ruinous heap
The prophecy God will keep
What men thought was fulfilled before
Is yet coming to the fore
Damascus falls

[Verse 2]
Syria war between the nations
Not just conflicts, full invasions
America strikes the killing blow
As Isaiah told us long ago

[Bridge]
An ancient city from the dawn
Of history will be gone
Completely ruined in a day
Just as the prophets say

[Chorus]
Damascus falls, a ruinous heap
The prophecy God will keep
What men thought was fulfilled before
Is yet coming to the fore
Damascus falls

[Outro]
(Explosions fading)
Watch Syria...
