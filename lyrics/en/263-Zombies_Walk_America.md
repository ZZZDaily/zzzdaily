[Intro]
(Horror movie strings)
Reanimé shall arise...

[Verse 1]
In the early days nobody knew
What was killing, what was coming through
Bodies mangled, teeth marks in the flesh
Something rising from the walking dead

[Chorus]
Zombies walk America tonight
No police, no law, no safety in sight
From the vaccinated ones they came
Nothing will ever be the same
Zombies walk America

[Verse 2]
They can hear you from a mile away
Track your heartbeat, you're their prey
Fever hits them, then they turn
Roaring beasts with strength that burns

[Bridge]
Not everyone will change this way
A subset rising, judgment day
Those who took the needle's gift
Finding their humanity adrift

[Chorus]
Zombies walk America tonight
No police, no law, no safety in sight
From the vaccinated ones they came
Nothing will ever be the same
Zombies walk America

[Outro]
(Fading horror sounds)
This is our world now...
