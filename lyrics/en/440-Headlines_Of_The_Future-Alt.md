[Intro]
(Newspaper sounds)
I saw the headlines...

[Verse 1]
The Lord showed me news to come
Headlines when the world's undone
Events that haven't happened yet
Things no one will forget

[Chorus]
Headlines of the future read
Everything the prophets said
Coming true before your eyes
No more room for alibis
Headlines of the future

[Verse 2]
Economic crashes, wars begin
Natural disasters for our sin
Every prophecy fulfilled
Watch the headlines as God willed

[Bridge]
Like a scroll unrolling wide
Nothing from His word can hide
What was spoken shall be done
Watch the headlines one by one

[Chorus]
Headlines of the future read
Everything the prophets said
Coming true before your eyes
No more room for alibis
Headlines of the future

[Outro]
(Newspaper sounds fading)
Watch and pray...
