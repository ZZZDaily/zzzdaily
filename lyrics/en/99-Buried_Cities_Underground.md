[Intro]
They dug in New Mexico, found fifteen hundred rooms
Bigger than Buckingham, ancient tombs

[Verse 1]
Newspapers reported what they found below
Ancient cities buried that we're not supposed to know
Marble walls and sewers from before Christ was born
Advanced civilizations, their records torn

[Chorus]
Buried underground, where did they go?
Buildings with iron beams from long ago
More advanced than anything we have today
Hidden history they swept away

[Verse 2]
In the marsh they found a city five kilometers wide
Acropolis on a hilltop, nowhere left to hide
Streets as wide as modern roads for cars we drive
Twenty-five feet across, how'd they survive?

[Bridge]
Try to find these ruins on the internet
Wikipedia says they don't exist yet
But the newspapers from eighteen hundred prove
Someone wants this history removed

[Chorus]
Buried underground, where did they go?
Buildings with iron beams from long ago
More advanced than anything we have today
Hidden history they swept away

[Outro]
Who buried these cities? Was it mud that came?
Or someone who wanted to erase our name?
The dinosaur digs in the same locations
Guarding the truth of forgotten nations
