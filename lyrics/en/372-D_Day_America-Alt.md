[Intro]
(Beach invasion sounds)
Invasion day is coming...

[Verse 1]
Just as Normandy was stormed
America will be transformed
A D-Day upon her shores
Foreign armies at her doors

[Chorus]
D-Day America, the invasion comes
Foreign soldiers, foreign drums
What you did to other lands
Now is done by foreign hands
D-Day America

[Verse 2]
Landing crafts on every coast
The thing America feared the most
Her enemies have breached the shore
America is no more

[Bridge]
The day appointed has arrived
Few Americans survived
The judgment written long ago
Fulfilled as prophets said it so

[Chorus]
D-Day America, the invasion comes
Foreign soldiers, foreign drums
What you did to other lands
Now is done by foreign hands
D-Day America

[Outro]
(Invasion sounds fading)
The day approaches...
