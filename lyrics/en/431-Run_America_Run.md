[Intro]
(Running footsteps, urgency)
The time to flee is now...

[Verse 1]
I dreamt we all were running fast
Through stadiums, the die is cast
Displacement coming to this land
Run while you still can stand

[Chorus]
Run America run tonight
Flee the judgment, take your flight
What you did to others comes
Displacement for your sons
Run America run

[Verse 2]
Refugees from America
Flooding to Canada
Mexicans showing love
To those who shut them out above

[Bridge]
As you have done, it's done to you
The scattering of people true
Millions flee from every state
Run before it's too late

[Chorus]
Run America run tonight
Flee the judgment, take your flight
What you did to others comes
Displacement for your sons
Run America run

[Outro]
(Running sounds fading)
Run while you can...
