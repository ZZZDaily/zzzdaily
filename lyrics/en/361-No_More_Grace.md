[Intro]
(Church bells silencing)
The grace period has ended...

[Verse 1]
God said no more grace remains
For America's endless stains
The patience of the Lord has stopped
Mercy's final curtain dropped

[Chorus]
No more grace for Babylon
The time of mercy's gone
Judgment has begun its run
No more grace, the time has come
No more grace

[Verse 2]
Every prayer for the nation
Met with heaven's condemnation
God won't hear the pleas anymore
Judgment knocking at the door

[Bridge]
Individual repentance still
Can align with heaven's will
But for the nation as a whole
No more grace, judgment's toll

[Chorus]
No more grace for Babylon
The time of mercy's gone
Judgment has begun its run
No more grace, the time has come
No more grace

[Outro]
(Silence)
Repent personally...
