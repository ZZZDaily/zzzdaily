[Intro]
(Conspiracy sounds)
Treachery from within...

[Verse 1]
America betrayed by her own
Seeds of destruction she has sown
Politicians selling out the nation
Every deal a dark foundation

[Chorus]
The betrayer betrays tonight
Selling out in broad daylight
Those you trusted most of all
Architect of your downfall
The betrayer betrays

[Verse 2]
China owns so many souls
Politicians in their control
Russian bribes and foreign money
Turning America's future bloody

[Bridge]
While you wave your patriot flags
They fill their money bags
Every secret sold for gold
America bought and sold

[Chorus]
The betrayer betrays tonight
Selling out in broad daylight
Those you trusted most of all
Architect of your downfall
The betrayer betrays

[Outro]
(Conspiracy sounds fading)
Treachery everywhere...
