[Intro]
(Arctic winds, approaching armies)
From the north they come...

[Verse 1]
Out of the north the armies come
Beating their war drums
Russia leads the charge tonight
America in their sight

[Chorus]
Out of the north, the prophecy true
Jeremiah told you what they'd do
From the north destruction pours
Invading through your doors
Out of the north

[Verse 2]
Through Alaska, through the ice
America pays the price
Nothing stops the northern tide
Nowhere for you to hide

[Bridge]
Every prophet said it clear
From the north you have to fear
The bear awakens from his den
To destroy the pride of men

[Chorus]
Out of the north, the prophecy true
Jeremiah told you what they'd do
From the north destruction pours
Invading through your doors
Out of the north

[Outro]
(Arctic winds intensifying)
They're coming...
