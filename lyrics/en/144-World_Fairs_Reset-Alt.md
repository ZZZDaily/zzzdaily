[Intro]
They built impossible buildings in a year
Then tore them down and made them disappear

[Verse 1]
World's Fairs all across the land
Buildings impossible to understand
Electric lights before the grid was set
Architecture we haven't matched yet

[Chorus]
World's Fair reset, demolish and move on
Destroy the evidence before the dawn
Were they really built or were they already there?
Repurposed ruins, nobody seems to care

[Verse 2]
White City Chicago, destroyed by flame
But stone doesn't burn, what's the game?
Same story everywhere they held
Buildings demolished, history expelled

[Bridge]
Old photographs show impossible scale
Technology beyond the official tale
Free energy powering the show
Before they took it underground below

[Chorus]
World's Fair reset, demolish and move on
Destroy the evidence before the dawn
Were they really built or were they already there?
Repurposed ruins, nobody seems to care

[Outro]
What if the narrative is all a lie?
Buildings from before made us ask why
So they burned and buried the past
Creating a history that wouldn't last
