[Intro]
(War council sounds)
The nations demand labor...

[Verse 1]
I saw a meeting in the dark
Leaders making their mark
A labor shortage plagued their lands
So they issued their demands

[Chorus]
Send for their flesh, the council said
America's bodies living or dead
We need their labor, take them all
Answer when we come to call
Send for their flesh

[Verse 2]
Russia, China, and Ukraine
Dividing up what will remain
American bodies for their use
Slavery is their excuse

[Bridge]
The meeting excluded Western eyes
A plan of conquest in disguise
Send for their flesh became the cry
Under a dark and foreign sky

[Chorus]
Send for their flesh, the council said
America's bodies living or dead
We need their labor, take them all
Answer when we come to call
Send for their flesh

[Outro]
(Council sounds fading)
They're coming for you...
