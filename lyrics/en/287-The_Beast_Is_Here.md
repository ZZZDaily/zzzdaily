[Intro]
(Ominous throne room sounds)
The man of sin revealed...

[Verse 1]
Obama is the beast, the Lord has said
The one who seemed politically dead
Rising back to power yet again
The little horn, the prince of wicked men

[Chorus]
The beast is here, walking among you now
Before his throne all nations bow
Ascendancy comes to he who fell
The beast arises straight from hell
The beast is here

[Verse 2]
Smooth words and promises of peace
But underneath the violence won't cease
He'll rule the world with iron fist
The one who God said to resist

[Bridge]
Two minus one, Biden falls away
Harris won't complete her day
The beast returns as prophesied
The whole world chose the devil's side

[Chorus]
The beast is here, walking among you now
Before his throne all nations bow
Ascendancy comes to he who fell
The beast arises straight from hell
The beast is here

[Outro]
(Dark throne room sounds fading)
Do not worship the beast...
