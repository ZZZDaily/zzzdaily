[Intro]
(Digital synths with ominous choir)
They simulate the future before it arrives
Running exercises while democracy dies

[Verse 1]
World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab at the helm
Running simulations to overwhelm the realm
Event 201 came months before COVID spread
Now Cyber Polygon warns of systems going dead
Russia's Sberbank partnered, global banks all aligned
Practicing the cyber pandemic for our minds

[Chorus]
Cyber Polygon prophecy, written in code
They show us what they're planning, then they hit the load
Cyber Polygon prophecy, simulation games
When the grid goes dark, remember who to blame

[Verse 2]
Financial system vulnerable, or so they like to say
Carnegie Endowment mapping out the way
Merge the banks with intelligence, national security state
Create the crisis first, then provide the fate
Digital currency ready when the old system falls
Total surveillance economy behind these walls

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Just like Event 201
Predicted what came true
The simulation becomes reality
They're telling me and you

[Verse 3]
Fourth Industrial Revolution needs the reset to begin
They destroy what exists so their new world can win
But we see the pattern now, the predictive programming game
Cyber Polygon prophecy, we know who to name

[Outro]
(Digital fade with choir)
They simulate, then execute, that's how the game is played
Cyber Polygon prophecy, don't be afraid
