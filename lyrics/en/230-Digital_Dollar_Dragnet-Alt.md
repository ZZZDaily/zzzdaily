[Intro]
(Cash register transforms to digital beep)
Cash is freedom, that's what they know
Digital dollar dragnet, watch your money flow

[Verse 1]
Fed Now system launching, instant payments ring
Digital dollar dragnet, tracking everything
Former Biden advisor said it loud and clear
Digital dollar will make private crypto disappear
Crowd out the competition, national security claim
Digital dollar dragnet, total surveillance game

[Chorus]
Digital dollar dragnet, every cent you spend
Monitored and recorded from beginning to end
Digital dollar dragnet, programmable control
Turn off the dissenters, that's the goal

[Verse 2]
ISO 20022 standard, November deadline set
Digital dollar dragnet, casting the net
Businesses first, then consumers in line
Digital dollar dragnet, by design
Cash for criminals, that's what they say
Digital dollar dragnet, takes freedom away

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
When every dollar knows
Exactly where it went
Financial privacy
Is money well spent

[Verse 3]
Whitney Webb reported on the coming scheme
Digital dollar dragnet, waking from the dream
Use cash while you can, support alternatives
Digital dollar dragnet takes more than it gives

[Outro]
(Digital sounds fade to cash drawer)
Preserve financial freedom before it's gone
Digital dollar dragnet, fight on
