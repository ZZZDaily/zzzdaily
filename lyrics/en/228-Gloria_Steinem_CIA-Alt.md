[Intro]
(60s protest sounds, revelation)
Gloria Steinem, feminist icon's name
CIA connections, part of the game

[Verse 1]
Funded by the CIA, documented and true
Independent Women's Forum, what they do
The feminist movement had handlers from the start
Gloria Steinem CIA, playing the part
Cultural operations shaping every side
Gloria Steinem CIA couldn't hide

[Chorus]
Gloria Steinem CIA, hidden in the cause
Intelligence operations, bending all the laws
Gloria Steinem CIA, movements captured too
Who controls the opposition? Now you have a clue

[Verse 2]
Playboy mansion CIA connections clear
Ms. Magazine funded, nothing to fear?
Hugh Hefner's world tied to intelligence
Gloria Steinem CIA, making sense
Both sides of culture wars managed from above
Gloria Steinem CIA, engineered love

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
When the movements you trust
Have handlers in place
Every revolution
Needs to check its face

[Verse 3]
Whitney Webb referenced this in broader schemes
Gloria Steinem CIA, bursting seams
True liberation requires seeing clear
Gloria Steinem CIA, face the fear

[Outro]
(Protest sounds fade)
Liberation movements must be truly free
Gloria Steinem CIA, let it be
