[Intro]
(Sky sounds, tiny footsteps)
I saw them walking on the sky...

[Verse 1]
Little men upon the clouds
Walking high above the crowds
Small grey beings in the air
What I saw was truly there

[Chorus]
The little men walking in the sky
Soon the world will wonder why
Alien disclosure coming soon
Under the dark blue moon
Little men walking

[Verse 2]
Not from space, they fell from grace
Demon beings taking place
The invasion long prepared
Will catch humanity unprepared

[Bridge]
What the world calls UFOs
Heaven's fallen traitors go
Walking through dimensional gates
Fulfilling prophecy's debates

[Chorus]
The little men walking in the sky
Soon the world will wonder why
Alien disclosure coming soon
Under the dark blue moon
Little men walking

[Outro]
(Sky sounds fading)
They are fallen angels...
