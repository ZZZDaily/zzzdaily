[Intro]
(Voices speaking, layered)
God speaks in many ways...

[Verse 1]
Dreams and visions through the night
Prophets speaking what is right
God has many ways to speak
To those who genuinely seek

[Chorus]
The many words of God go forth
To every corner, south and north
Through His servants, through His Word
Every warning must be heard
The many words of God

[Verse 2]
In these last days, Joel said
God will pour His Spirit instead
On all flesh, young and old
Every prophecy must be told

[Bridge]
If you have ears then hear today
What the Spirit has to say
Don't harden your heart anymore
Open up that final door

[Chorus]
The many words of God go forth
To every corner, south and north
Through His servants, through His Word
Every warning must be heard
The many words of God

[Outro]
(Voices harmonizing)
Hear the Lord...
