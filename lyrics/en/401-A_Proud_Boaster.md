[Intro]
(Boastful speeches)
Pride goes before a fall...

[Verse 1]
Obama is the proud boaster
Promoted on every poster
The man of sin in plain sight
Preparing for his final fight

[Chorus]
A proud boaster walks the land
With a microchip in hand
Words of honey, heart of stone
Coming for the beast's throne
A proud boaster

[Verse 2]
His mouth speaks arrogant things
Like the little horn that kings
Blasphemy against the Most High
Time will prove this isn't a lie

[Bridge]
America chose this man
Fulfilling Satan's plan
The antichrist in your midst
On this truth I must insist

[Chorus]
A proud boaster walks the land
With a microchip in hand
Words of honey, heart of stone
Coming for the beast's throne
A proud boaster

[Outro]
(Speeches fading)
Beware the boaster...
