[Intro]
(UN sounds, global imagery)
Agenda 2030 sounds good on paper clean
Sustainable Development trap, see what it means

[Verse 1]
UN goals with pretty names and logos bright
Sustainable Development trap, hiding in plain sight
Hijacked environmental movement, corporate control
Sustainable Development trap takes its toll
Rockefeller Foundation shaped this from the start
Sustainable Development trap, dark heart

[Chorus]
Sustainable Development trap, sounds good to believe
But the fine print tells us what they'll achieve
Sustainable Development trap, SDG control
Planetary management, that's the goal

[Verse 2]
Digital surveillance of both people and planet
Sustainable Development trap, understand it
Jacob Nordangard traced the oligarch roots
Sustainable Development trap, bearing fruits
From Club of Rome to WEF today
Sustainable Development trap paves the way

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Environmental protection
Weaponized for control
Sustainability becomes
A digital patrol

[Verse 3]
Whitney Webb interviewed those who know
Sustainable Development trap, seeds they sow
True sustainability isn't in their hands
Sustainable Development trap, break the bands

[Outro]
(UN sounds fade)
Real sustainability is local and free
Sustainable Development trap, let it be
