[Intro]
(Gavels, then breaking sounds)
Justice has departed...

[Verse 1]
The courts are corrupt, the judges paid
Every ruling has been made
In favor of the wicked few
Justice no longer true

[Chorus]
A broken rule of law remains
Criminals running through the lanes
No enforcement, no one cares
Crime is climbing everywhere
Broken rule of law

[Verse 2]
Police defunded, courts dismissed
Every safeguard you have missed
Lawlessness becomes the norm
The perfect breeding ground for storm

[Bridge]
When no law exists to save
Every person digs a grave
The strong prey on the weak
Justice is what they seek

[Chorus]
A broken rule of law remains
Criminals running through the lanes
No enforcement, no one cares
Crime is climbing everywhere
Broken rule of law

[Outro]
(Breaking sounds fading)
Only God is Judge...
