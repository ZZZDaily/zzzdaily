[Intro]
(Robot/humanoid sounds)
Not fully human...

[Verse 1]
Created in the laboratory
Not God's but Satan's story
Synthetics that look like you and me
Without a soul, they cannot see

[Chorus]
Synthetics walk among us now
Created, no one knows how
Looking human, acting same
But lacking heaven's flame
Synthetics among us

[Verse 2]
Clones grown from DNA
Living in a synthetic way
No breath of life from God above
Incapable of heavenly love

[Bridge]
Abominations in God's sight
Walking in the day and night
They cannot repent or be saved
Their destination is the grave

[Chorus]
Synthetics walk among us now
Created, no one knows how
Looking human, acting same
But lacking heaven's flame
Synthetics among us

[Outro]
(Robot sounds fading)
Discern the spirits...
