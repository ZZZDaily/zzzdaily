[Intro]
(Construction sounds)
Count the cost...

[Verse 1]
The Lord says build My house today
Not with gold but with your way
Count the cost before you start
Build Me a temple in your heart

[Chorus]
Build My house, the Lord does say
Not of bricks that fall away
Build with faith and build with love
Materials from above
Build My house

[Verse 2]
Foundations laid on solid rock
Not on sand when troubles knock
Jesus is the cornerstone
Build on Him and Him alone

[Bridge]
Wood and hay and stubble burn
Gold and silver what you earn
What survives the testing fire?
Only that which God desires

[Chorus]
Build My house, the Lord does say
Not of bricks that fall away
Build with faith and build with love
Materials from above
Build My house

[Outro]
(Construction sounds fading)
Build on the Rock...
