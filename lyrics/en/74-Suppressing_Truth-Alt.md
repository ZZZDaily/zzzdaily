SONG 2: "Suppressing Truth"
(Theme: An exploration of those who hold down or hide knowledge, drawing from Romans 1 about truth being concealed in unrighteousness.)

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
They black it out, they white it out, redact the page,
Freedom of Information but the truth's in a cage,
Ask a question 'bout the atmosphere above,
Suddenly classified, where'd the answers go, love?

[Chorus]
They suppress the truth in unrighteousness,
Hold it down, keep you blind in the wilderness,
But the Word won't return void, it cuts through the lies,
Open up your eyes, let the scales fall from your eyes.

[Verse 2]
Pastors losing minds when you question their creed,
"It's metaphor, refraction," whatever you need,
Said it to my face with a scholarly grin,
While the documents sit locked in a government bin.

[Chorus]
They suppress the truth in unrighteousness,
Hold it down, keep you blind in the wilderness,
But the Word won't return void, it cuts through the lies,
Open up your eyes, let the scales fall from your eyes.

[Verse 3]
Creation ministries preaching what they're told,
Call you crazy for the questions that you hold,
Screenshots don't lie, see 'em panic and deflect,
When the firmament don't fit what they expect.

[Verse 4]
Romans 1 said they knew but wouldn't say,
Traded truth for a lie, led the sheep astray,
Holding down knowledge like it's classified intel,
But the truth breaks chains, breaks you out of that cell.

[Chorus]
They suppress the truth in unrighteousness,
Hold it down, keep you blind in the wilderness,
But the Word won't return void, it cuts through the lies,
Open up your eyes, let the scales fall from your eyes.

[Bridge]
Why you hiding what the Scripture plainly shows?
Why you mocking those who seek what no one knows?
They don't want you reading, don't want you aware,
But the King of Truth is calling—do you dare?

[Chorus]
They suppress the truth in unrighteousness,
Hold it down, keep you blind in the wilderness,
But the Word won't return void, it cuts through the lies,
Open up your eyes, let the scales fall from your eyes.

[Outro]
Let the scales fall... from your eyes,
No more suppressing... the truth inside.
