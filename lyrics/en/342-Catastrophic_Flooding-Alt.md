[Intro]
(Rushing waters, rain)
Woe to the cities...

[Verse 1]
Floods are coming to the land
Waters rising, waves expand
Coastal cities washed away
Catastrophic judgment day

[Chorus]
Catastrophic flooding comes
Rivers overflow their drums
What was built will wash away
The water comes to stay
Catastrophic flooding

[Verse 2]
Climate chaos everywhere
Natural disasters fill the air
Not just weather, heaven's voice
America, you made your choice

[Bridge]
The 'Stans will flood, Africa too
God's judgment breaking through
Cities underwater go
Waters rising ever slow

[Chorus]
Catastrophic flooding comes
Rivers overflow their drums
What was built will wash away
The water comes to stay
Catastrophic flooding

[Outro]
(Water sounds fading)
Higher ground...
