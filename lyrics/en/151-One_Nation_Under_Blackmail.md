[Intro]
(Slow organ, building tension)
In the corridors of power, secrets buy their way
Every handshake hides a threat, debts they never pay

[Verse 1]
From the National Crime Syndicate to intelligence's door
Meyer Lansky's network spread from shore to shore
Sexual blackmail tactics, passed down through the years
Epstein was a frontman, they profited from fears
Israeli connections running deep and wide
Mossad and CIA standing side by side

[Chorus]
One nation under blackmail
One nation under lies
They built an empire on our silence
While corruption never dies
One nation under blackmail
Compromised from the start
They own the judges, own the Congress
They own every beating heart

[Verse 2]
Whitney Webb exposed it all, documented every thread
The sordid union of the spies and criminals they bred
From Roy Cohn to Jeffrey Epstein, the pattern stays the same
Sexual compromise operations, they all play the game
Politicians, businessmen, nobody is clean
When intelligence and organized crime run the machine

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
They photograph your secrets
They record your every sin
Then they own you like a puppet
Now let the truth begin

[Verse 3]
This isn't left or right, it's the powerful elite
Running operations that keep us all beneath
But the files are coming out now, the truth begins to shine
One nation under blackmail, it's time to cut the line

[Outro]
(Organ fades with choir)
Wake up, America, see the chains they made
One nation under blackmail, but the debt will be repaid
