[Intro]
(Industrial sounds, dark synths)
Iain Davis wrote the book on what's coming next
Technocratic dark state, leaving us perplexed

[Verse 1]
The counter-elites and globalists, two sides of one coin
Tech billionaires and bankers, their agendas join
Trump's administration filled with Silicon Valley dreams
Thiel and Musk and Sacks running things behind the scenes
They promise to fight the deep state, drain the swamp they say
But build the same surveillance grid in a different way

[Chorus]
Technocratic dark state, worse than what we had
Global oligarchs rebranding, think of it as sad
Technocratic dark state, left or right illusion
Same control grid rising through the confusion

[Verse 2]
DOGE supposedly cutting waste and fraud galore
But Palantir gets the contracts, surveillance at the core
They talk of freedom while they build the digital cage
Same agenda, different actors on the stage
The populist saviors serve the same machine
Technocratic dark state, the darkest we've seen

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Different flavors of tyranny
Liberal or conservative brand
But the technocrats keep building
The same control command

[Verse 3]
Whitney Webb keeps warning us, don't fall for the show
Technocratic dark state, now you finally know
The solution isn't in their politics at all
Technocratic dark state, we have to break the wall

[Outro]
(Industrial fades to silence)
Build something different, outside their control
Technocratic dark state can't capture your soul
