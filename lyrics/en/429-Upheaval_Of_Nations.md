[Intro]
(Global chaos sounds)
The nations shake...

[Verse 1]
Every nation under heaven
Rocked and broken, torn and shaken
Upheaval coming everywhere
Nothing stable, none to spare

[Chorus]
Upheaval of the nations now
Every ruler forced to bow
Earthquakes political and real
This is God's almighty deal
Upheaval of nations

[Verse 2]
Governments collapsing fast
Nothing built to ever last
Revolutions everywhere
People crying in despair

[Bridge]
Only God's kingdom stands alone
Unshaken on its heavenly throne
While earthly empires fall like sand
His dominion stays at hand

[Chorus]
Upheaval of the nations now
Every ruler forced to bow
Earthquakes political and real
This is God's almighty deal
Upheaval of nations

[Outro]
(Chaos transforming to order)
His kingdom comes...
