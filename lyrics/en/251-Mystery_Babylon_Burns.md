[Intro]
(Haunting orchestral strings)
Babylon the great... is fallen, is fallen...

[Verse 1]
She sits upon the waters with her cup of wine
Drunk on the blood of prophets since the dawn of time
America, America, your judgment day has come
The Lord has written on your wall, your kingdom is undone

[Chorus]
Mystery Babylon burns tonight
Fire from the sky, judgment's light
What took centuries to build
In one hour shall be killed
Mystery Babylon burns

[Verse 2]
You traded souls of men like merchandise and gold
The saints cry out from under, their blood is never cold
Heaven keeps account of every debt you owe
The cup is double filled, prepare for overflow

[Bridge]
Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin
Weighed and found wanting, your doom begins
The merchants weep as smoke ascends
This is how your story ends

[Chorus]
Mystery Babylon burns tonight
Fire from the sky, judgment's light
What took centuries to build
In one hour shall be killed
Mystery Babylon burns

[Outro]
(Fading orchestral swells)
Come out of her, my people...
Come out of her...
