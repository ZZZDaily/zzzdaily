[Intro]
(Dark synth pulses)
And he causes all...

[Verse 1]
A needle bigger than it needs to be
Something inside that changes you and me
They said it's safe, they said it's for your health
But God revealed the truth about this wealth

[Chorus]
The vaccine of the beast, it changes DNA
The preliminary mark, they're taking souls away
Binding you to something dark you cannot understand
The vaccine of the beast is spreading through the land

[Verse 2]
Some will mutate, some will walk again
Reanimé rising from the bodies of men
Those who took it willing, they'll be prone to more
Opening the door to what was sealed before

[Bridge]
To those who were forced against their will
The Lord will make it water still
But those who chose it freely given
May find the narrow path to heaven closed

[Chorus]
The vaccine of the beast, it changes DNA
The preliminary mark, they're taking souls away
Binding you to something dark you cannot understand
The vaccine of the beast is spreading through the land

[Outro]
(Fading synth)
Do not take it... do not take...
