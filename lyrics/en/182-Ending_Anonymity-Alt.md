[Intro]
(Slow piano, mournful)
WEF Partnership Against Cybercrime they call it now
Ending anonymity, let me tell you how

[Verse 1]
Driver's license for the internet, that's the goal
KYC for every click, monitoring your soul
They say it's about cybersecurity, protecting you from harm
But the real target is privacy, raising the alarm
Financial anonymity is terrorist they say
When you can't move money freely, you can't get away

[Chorus]
Ending anonymity, their mission statement clear
No more privacy online, that's what they engineer
Ending anonymity, verified ID
To access the internet, you'll never be free

[Verse 2]
Verify digital ID program in the UK
Tony Blair is pushing it harder every day
EU's new digital ID spreading through the zone
Every account, every service, monitored alone
The infrastructure being built connects it all
Ending anonymity, waiting for the fall

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
They say anonymity
Enables all the crime
But surveillance of the innocent
Happens all the time

[Verse 3]
Whitney Webb exposed the WEF-PAC master plan
Ending anonymity is how they'll control man
But encryption still exists, privacy tools remain
Ending anonymity doesn't have to be our chain

[Outro]
(Piano fades)
Protect your privacy before it's fully gone
Ending anonymity or freedom carries on
