SONG 5: "Engineers and Believers"
(Theme: Personal testimonies of skeptics, scientists, and former agnostics who found faith through unexpected paths of inquiry.)

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I was taught the earth curves beneath our feet,
Believed the numbers, trusted the elite,
But measurements don't lie when you do the math,
A hundred forty-six miles on a laser path.

[Verse 2]
Microwave signal, coast to coast it beams,
Through twelve thousand feet of curve it seems,
But straight line sight where a mountain should block,
Started questioning everything on the clock.

[Chorus]
Engineers and believers, seekers of what's real,
Scientists and doubters learning how to kneel,
When the data doesn't match what you've been told,
You find the truth is written, ancient and bold.

[Verse 3]
I've seen flat water, never seen it bulge,
The calculations made my skeptic brain indulge,
Two point three eight miles should hide that dish,
But there it stands—something's amiss.

[Verse 4]
From particle physics to the dome above,
Every honest question led me to His love,
The firmament they mocked is written clear,
The more I studied hard, the more He drew me near.

[Chorus]
Engineers and believers, seekers of what's real,
Scientists and doubters learning how to kneel,
When the data doesn't match what you've been told,
You find the truth is written, ancient and bold.

[Bridge]
They said "trust the science," but I ran the test,
The evidence kept pointing to a God who's blessed,
Not stupid, not crazy, just honest with eyes,
The creation testifies, cuts through the lies.

[Chorus]
Engineers and believers, seekers of what's real,
Scientists and doubters learning how to kneel,
When the data doesn't match what you've been told,
You find the truth is written, ancient and bold.

[Outro]
From questions to answers... the Truth made me whole,
The Engineer of heaven... now engineers my soul.
