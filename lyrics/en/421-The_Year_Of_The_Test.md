[Intro]
(Testing sounds, examination)
This year you will be tested...

[Verse 1]
The Lord has said this is the year
When everything you've built will shear
Testing comes for every soul
To see who's ready to be whole

[Chorus]
The year of the test is here
Face your faith and face your fear
Everything you say you believe
Will be tested, don't be deceived
The year of the test

[Verse 2]
Do you really trust the Lord?
Or do you just trust His reward?
When everything is taken away
Will you still have faith to pray?

[Bridge]
Job was tested, Abraham too
Now the testing comes to you
Will you stand when trials come?
Or will you turn and run?

[Chorus]
The year of the test is here
Face your faith and face your fear
Everything you say you believe
Will be tested, don't be deceived
The year of the test

[Outro]
(Testing sounds fading)
Stand firm in faith...
