[Intro]
(Snarling, approaching)
The dogs come for you...

[Verse 1]
I heard the Lord say dogs approach
Those who refused will face reproach
Coming for the unvaccinated
Those the system truly hated

[Chorus]
The dogs are coming for your door
Those who said no, there's something more
Persecution for the saints
Testing faith without restraints
The dogs are coming

[Verse 2]
They will hunt you down like prey
Make you pay for disobey
But the Lord will be your shield
Those to Him will never yield

[Bridge]
Like Jezebel was eaten whole
The dogs seek body and your soul
But those who trust in Jesus' name
Will never face that shame

[Chorus]
The dogs are coming for your door
Those who said no, there's something more
Persecution for the saints
Testing faith without restraints
The dogs are coming

[Outro]
(Snarling fading)
Stand firm...
