[Intro]
This is your wake-up call, humanity arise
Time to see the truth with your own eyes

[Verse 1]
MKUltra never stopped, Playboy was the mask
Income tax is illegal if you ever ask
Buried cities hiding our true past
Free energy murdered, how long will it last?

[Chorus]
Wake up, wake up, the world's not what they say
Controllers manipulating every single day
But knowledge is the weapon that breaks every chain
Time to free our minds and stop the pain

[Verse 2]
Freemasons, Illuminati, CIA combined
Same old bloodlines, intertwined
Psychology a hoax, education too
Everything designed to control you

[Bridge]
It's not about hate, it's about truth
Looking at evidence, finding the proof
Question everything the experts say
Research for yourself, that's the only way

[Chorus]
Wake up, wake up, the world's not what they say
Controllers manipulating every single day
But knowledge is the weapon that breaks every chain
Time to free our minds and stop the pain

[Outro]
Share the truth with everyone you know
This is how the freedom movement grows
Turn off the TV, pick up a book
Take a real hard independent look
The awakening is happening right now
Join the revolution, take a bow
