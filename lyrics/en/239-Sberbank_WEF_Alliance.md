[Intro]
(Russian and Western financial sounds merge)
East and West, they say they're fighting still
But Sberbank WEF alliance serves the same mill

[Verse 1]
Russia's largest bank partnered with the WEF
Cyber Polygon together, left and right deaf
BI.ZONE subsidiary running simulations
Sberbank WEF alliance across nations
Putin spoke at Davos, whatever he might say
Sberbank WEF alliance on display

[Chorus]
Sberbank WEF alliance, left and right illusion
Global elite united, causing confusion
Sberbank WEF alliance, same agenda served
Both sides of the conflict, control preserved

[Verse 2]
Young Global Leaders, Putin once was named
Sberbank WEF alliance, who's to be blamed?
The multipolar world, theater for the masses
Sberbank WEF alliance, different ruling classes
Same surveillance state, different flags they wave
Sberbank WEF alliance, freedom to save

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
When East meets West
At Davos' door
The conflicts we see
Might hide something more

[Verse 3]
Whitney Webb noted the unlikely pair
Sberbank WEF alliance, worldwide affair
Question every conflict, every narrative sold
Sberbank WEF alliance, truth be told

[Outro]
(Financial sounds harmonize then fade)
The real divisions aren't nation against nation
Sberbank WEF alliance, elite's foundation
