[Intro]
(Nature sounds, foreboding organ)
They're putting price tags on the rivers and trees
Natural Asset Corporations, ownership of the breeze

[Verse 1]
Rockefeller Foundation and the IDB designed
A way to privatize nature of every kind
NACs they call them, corporations that take control
Of forests and lakes that were once public soul
Sell shares to BlackRock, sovereign wealth funds too
Natural Asset Corporations colonizing what grew

[Chorus]
Natural Asset Corporations, nature up for sale
The commons being privatized, a financier's tale
Natural Asset Corporations, conservation's lie
They say they're saving the planet while they buy it dry

[Verse 2]
Intrinsic Exchange Group leading the charge
Making nature a commodity, corporate and large
Under the guise of preservation, they seize the land
Natural Asset Corporations, understand the plan
Every river, every watershed, gets a price tag now
Natural Asset Corporations show us how

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
They say it's to protect
What belongs to us all
But when Wall Street owns nature
Who answers the call?

[Verse 3]
Whitney Webb exposed the scheme before it spread
Natural Asset Corporations, the commons is not dead
We can fight for the public trust to remain
Natural Asset Corporations don't have to gain

[Outro]
(Nature sounds return, organ fades)
Nature belongs to no corporation's claim
Natural Asset Corporations, stop this game
