[Intro]
(Political speech sounds, then silence)
Two minus one...

[Verse 1]
Biden and Harris, two were chosen
But something in the plan was frozen
Two minus one the Lord has said
One will exit, maybe dead

[Chorus]
Biden plus Harris equals two minus one
Before their full term is done
Someone will not complete the race
Making room for another's face
Two minus one

[Verse 2]
A cockatrice will pursue them both
Neither keeping their sacred oath
Neither completing what they started
Before the antichrist is charted

[Bridge]
The beast returns through this transition
Fulfilling his dark mission
The game of politics just a show
For those who are in the know

[Chorus]
Biden plus Harris equals two minus one
Before their full term is done
Someone will not complete the race
Making room for another's face
Two minus one

[Outro]
(Political sounds cut off)
Watch the transition...
