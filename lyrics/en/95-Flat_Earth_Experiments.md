[Intro]
Parallax took his tools to the canal that day
What he found would shake the globe away

[Verse 1]
Eighteen hundreds, a man named Roebotham
Set up flags across six miles of land
If the earth was curved there'd be twenty-four feet
But every flag lined up, looking nice and neat

[Chorus]
Where's the curve? They said eight inches per mile
But we can see two hundred sixty-nine for a while
Pic Gaspard photographed from Spain
Guinness World Record, can science explain?

[Verse 2]
Civil engineers don't account for curve
Railway builders, they got the nerve
Pilots never learned about rotation
No drift correction in their aviation

[Bridge]
Antarctica is locked, can't go past sixty south
Try to explore and they'll shut your mouth
Every government agrees on that one treaty
Why so defensive, seems kind of seedy

[Chorus]
Where's the curve? They said eight inches per mile
But we can see two hundred sixty-nine for a while
Pic Gaspard photographed from Spain
Guinness World Record, can science explain?

[Outro]
Not saying flat, not saying round
Just asking questions that should be found
NASA won't show us footage that's real
What exactly are they trying to conceal?
