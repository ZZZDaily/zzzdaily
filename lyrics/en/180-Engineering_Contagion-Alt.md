[Intro]
(Laboratory sounds, eerie choir)
Gain of function research behind closed doors
Engineering contagion, biological wars

[Verse 1]
Soviet bioweapons labs got repurposed years ago
Nunn-Lugar Act transformed them, but the research still did flow
DARPA's Michael Callahan in Wuhan when it began
The man from US intelligence with the pandemic plan
Vector Institute and Fort Detrick, names you need to know
Engineering contagion, watching viruses grow

[Chorus]
Engineering contagion, making nature worse
Funded by our taxes, a scientific curse
Engineering contagion, dual-use research they say
Defense and offense blur, who will pay?

[Verse 2]
Anthrax attacks in 2001, Dark Winter came alive
The simulations became real, who would survive?
Fort Detrick connections buried in the news
Engineering contagion, following the clues
Lab leak or natural, they debate and fight
But the funding trails reveal the research in the night

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
They say it's for defense
To prepare for natural threats
But engineered pathogens
Are the deadliest bets

[Verse 3]
Whitney Webb and Sam Husseini connecting every dot
Engineering contagion, there's more than we've been taught
The bioweapons cartel operates worldwide
Engineering contagion, nowhere left to hide

[Outro]
(Lab sounds fade to silence)
Stop the research now before the next release
Engineering contagion threatens all our peace
