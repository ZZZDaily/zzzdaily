[Intro]
They found giant bones but called them dinosaurs
When the truth is something different that they hide behind closed doors

[Verse 1]
Rockefeller funded every major find
Museum exhibits, controlling every mind
Same locations where the ruins were found
Dinosaur digs on sacred ground

[Verse 2]
Giant humans walked before the flood
But they can't let you know about their blood
Nephilim bones relabeled reptile
Keeping the biblical evidence in their file

[Chorus]
Dinosaur dig deception, fossils on demand
Plaster cast creations buried in the sand
Why are all the bones behind the rope?
Because looking too closely destroys their hope

[Bridge]
Same families own the dig sites and museums
Creating narratives, and you just see them
Evolution taught to separate from God
Making man an accident is their favorite fraud

[Chorus]
Dinosaur dig deception, fossils on demand
Plaster cast creations buried in the sand
Why are all the bones behind the rope?
Because looking too closely destroys their hope

[Outro]
The real history is far more strange
Giants walking through our mountain range
But they buried that with the Tartars too
Rewriting history for me and you
