[Intro]
Scan your face, scan your eyes
Welcome to the digital demise

[Verse 1]
New identity laws coming through
Biometric scans for me and you
Can't buy or sell without the mark
Digital prison, technological dark

[Chorus]
The beast system rising every day
Papers please but in a digital way
Your face becomes your ID card
Living free is getting hard

[Verse 2]
They track your movement through the phone
Every purchase, every zone
Social credit coming to the West
Pass their tests or fail the rest

[Bridge]
Revelation warned us long ago
The mark of the beast would grow and grow
No conspiracy when it's in plain sight
Accept the chip or lose your rights

[Chorus]
The beast system rising every day
Papers please but in a digital way
Your face becomes your ID card
Living free is getting hard

[Outro]
Resist the system while you can
They're trying to control every woman and man
Cash is king, stay off the grid
Before they make freedom something that's forbid
